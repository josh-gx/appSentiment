You can't view the lectures at both landscape positions, but only the one that the designers thought of which sucks. but worse of all - if you add subtitles, YOU CAN'T REMOVE IT!!!",1

4/5/2019,i love pluralsight. the quality of the content is great. The Android app can be frustrating. If i switch between the pluralsight app and another app the video will restart from the beginning. Ugg. The offline videos feature of the app is nice though.,3
4/3/2019,"Can't cast to Chromecast. The only way I'm able to cast this app is to mirror my entire S7's screen. Would love to be able to cast the app successfully to my TV. I use Chromecast everyday with other apps & no issues. When casting with this, only the Pluralsight logo appears on the screen, no audio, and play/pause buttons are nonresponsive.",2

4/1/2019,It is such a boon for anyone who wants to excel in technical world. We have learnt about off the job and on the job trainings in Business Management rules. This is the new world of anytime training. There is a vast collection of courses for everyone. Although there are some glitches like videos get an error if I flip my phone from horizontal to vertical or vice-a-versa while playing a video. So it gets started from the beginning. Sometimes I had the whole chapter getting started from scratch.,4

2/17/2019,"Chromecast support FTW! Pluralsight's offerings are tremendously useful. On the Android app their excellent service is complimented with casting support for both video and/or audio only, ie Chromecast, Google home and other smart displays. I couldnt be happier with the usefulness of their app and courses.",5
2/15/2019,won't let me stream on my phone without wifi despite changing the settings to allow,1
2/15/2019,Much improved app.,4
2/12/2019,disabling 'require wifi for [...]' changes nothing and videos still require wifi. quite annoying since I'd like to watch some videos during my morning commute,3
2/12/2019,Wonderful app. well maintained. And there is no discomfort in this app also its exactly same as website.,5

1/31/2019,I was not able to rotate the screen to landscape mode on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet ☹,5
1/31/2019,I would give a 5 star but app doesn't work well offline.  I often watch my downloaded courses on the tube but when I click downloads I have to wait about 3 mins.  It's like it's trying to get online and a timeout is kicking in.  Then Finally I see a list of my downloads and click a course and then again an annoying 3 minute wait watching the spinner,4
1/31/2019,Wonderful explanation ... Love the dark mode more than anything !!! But course download and download speed sucks !!! Stucks often when downloading and I get a notification download cancelled for no reason !!!,4
1/31/2019,Feedback has been heard and contents are great.,5
1/30/2019,I am giving 3 stars just to Pluralsight and the app after the last update has become pretty bad. If I am using my phone with auto rotate off then I don't see any option to change the course slide into landscape mode. When watching course if I swipe down the presentation scrolls downward and there is no direct way to restore it back. Same is the case when I move to my home screen leaving app minimized then if I go back into app it shows black screen again there is no direct way to bring it back,3
1/29/2019,It is a good learning platform and the courses are structured.,5
1/29/2019,"worth every penny. I would have been screwed without it, when I started my new job",5
1/29/2019,am unable to download the app..any issue,2
1/29/2019,why downloading not working?,2
1/26/2019,"after suthorizing device nothing happens, the only thing that i can do is to go back to login page",1
1/26/2019,"covers most subjects I need, with reasonable breadth.",5
1/26/2019,You ruined your app again with the latest update.,1
1/26/2019,"I'm not sure what they've done with the latest version, but they seem to have removed the option to pick which videos within the course you can play unless you are in portrait mode. In the video player there used to be a menu on the right that you could swipe in to pick a new video. Please put it back to how it was!",3
1/25/2019,pretty stable.,5
1/25/2019,Great content,5
1/24/2019,"Horrible user interface, re-add the full screen button.",1
1/24/2019,good content,5
1/24/2019,"last update: UI is good, but the video player is worse than before. There's no fullscreen button, when I swipe my screen from above (see battery, notif, etc), the player just auto-hide. That's awful. Beside than that is better. Thanks",3
1/23/2019,Lovely design and easy to use,5
1/23/2019,i have chosen external card as the storage location for downloads but it still comsumes internal memory.,2
1/22/2019,Appears to work properly when streaming. Update: plays fine off- and on-line now. would be nice if you could add notes and bookmarks at specific times.,3
1/20/2019,I've subscribed to Pluralsight for years. The courses are thorough and typically well made. Very happy with their service.,5
1/19/2019,"Pluralsight is a great service, but casting to Chromecast in this app is buggy (does not go to next video if the phone screen went off, restarts video as app is refocused,...) and this renders the app pretty much useless for me. Edit: As beginning of 2019,I'm noticing this issue resolved and hence increasing the rating!",5
1/19/2019,"Nice training, well organized. Despite the paradox of offering some of the best developer courses out there, my only shock is the extreme minimalism and lack of engaging and interactive features to finish up the job on preparing all the trainings and learning paths. To be honest, you can feel the deep dev roots without marketing and creative design teams near, if you compare with the radically different approach of LinkedIn learning. Contents 10/10, presentation needs an extra push. Keep going!",5
1/18/2019,courses/content are getting slowly better.,4
1/17/2019,best educational apps,5

1/2/2019,the app works fine on my Lenovo phone but on my Samsung tab 3 it has started showing error &quot; wifi required for streaming&quot; even though the Wi-Fi is working and I am able to run other apps like YouTube .,1
12/30/2018,Course contents are very well structured. The course player has multiple control options. Quality of the content is very good.,5

12/13/2018,"Some of these teachers are completely out of touch with reality. The introduction video to one of the courses stated that I needed a computer with a minimum of 16 but preferably 32 gigs of RAM. My phone has a better and faster processor than both of my computer's, as well as more ram overall, and none of these devices comes even remotely close to 16 gigs of RAM, let alone 32. Does he even know what these corporations sell us regular people? They don't start us off with sixteen gigs of RAM dude. Commercial businesses are trying to make money, not sell us high quality electronics.",1

12/11/2018,"The app had serious bugs on my Huawei Mate 10, the app will not recognise downloaded videos and always attempts to stream the videos even after downloading the entire course.

12/10/2018,Great content for coders,5
12/9/2018,Really helpful,5
12/6/2018,Very Good app. I moved away from the browser version to the android app version for ease of use. However I noticed that the exercise files are available for download on browser versions and not on android app? Any particular reasons for restrictions on app?,5

12/2/2018,I love the angular course in pluralsight,5
11/28/2018,badly behaved app. keeps 'initalizing' and causes Android to pop up 'pluralsight is using battery'. Ironic that a training site has a poorly made app.,2
11/27/2018,love the black Friday deal,5
11/26/2018,"Pluralsight maintains a high standard, and they have my respect",5
11/26/2018,Awesome for all the professionals,5

11/9/2018,Great app better then the ios version,5
11/9/2018,A great website for personal development,5
11/9/2018,It's useless. It doesn't allow me to use it on LTE. Has to be connected to WiFi which defeats the purpose of being used on a portable device. If I can use WiFi then I can use a laptop. Why bother with an app on a dinky cell phone screen? Stupid,1
11/8/2018,Cool....,5

10/15/2018,Perfect for learning,5
10/11/2018,The app doesn't work on mobile data which is pointless for an app to be used on the go. In theory you can change settings to enable this (as others commenting o this issue were advised) but it seems that even after changing the settings videos still cannot be played on mobile data.,3
10/11/2018,Excellent learning tool. It gives everything to become an expert in the subject.,5
10/10/2018,If I open a video and go to another app it starts the video from the beginning without resuming.,3

10/4/2018,Learning App with simple and clear design for best learners experience.,5
10/2/2018,This app needs Wi-fi to run it's video. Now if this is a mobile app you're expecting it to run on mobile data and not wi-fi. This criteria defeats the fundamental purpose of using the app,2
10/2/2018,"The app improved very much in the last months. I like it. Just would like to be able to see, which bookmarked courses I have already watched. I have hundreds of bookmarks and cannot keep track which ones still need to be watched...",5

9/21/2018,"unable to download course for offline viewing after downloading latest version. is there some bug... in latest version the notification says download complete, but i can't find the downloaded course",2
9/21/2018,The app doesn't save it's state when rotate and the video begins from the start again,3
9/21/2018,Download is not working in latest version,1
9/20/2018,"while playing videos over wifi if do backward, it will stuck then need to restart the video, which is time consuming specially when you are updating notes while watching course video.",1
9/20/2018,Good,4
9/19/2018,Its a best learning app from microsoft. I like it.,4
9/19/2018,Very useful,5
9/15/2018,"When resuming watching a course, it starts the lesson from the start of the clip and not at the place where you left off. Not very user friendly.",2
9/14/2018,Amazing to learn new things and the user interface and experience is very intuitive.,5
9/13/2018,I always get this error &quot; An error occurred when playing next video&quot;,3
9/11/2018,"Best content examples I've ever experienced. This app have tons of many tutorials, from beginners to advanced levels. I would always recommend this app for developers and for the people out there who want to learn how to program and create fabulous applications.",5
9/11/2018,I love pluralsight. I spend a lot of time commuting and the app allows me to download content and keep up with new technologies or learn something on the go,5
9/10/2018,"For all IT pros and Devs out there, this is one of the best platforms to learn numerous technology. All new courses gets added regularly at a very affordable rate. GOOD WORK PLURALSIGHT!",5
9/10/2018,Learn on the go!,5
9/10/2018,App has all sort of problems as reviewed by all users. Please do notify me to download after you fix it.,1
9/9/2018,Awful in terms of usage over cellular network,1
9/9/2018,Error while trying to play the videos,1
9/8/2018,Too many bugs and very bad user experience. 1. No video player plays the video when you turn off the screen. This app plays video in background!! And there is no setting to turn this off. 2. It always resumes the video from the beginning ! 3. Doesn't show rating count. just shows 4 star or 5 star! How do I compare two videos on same topic if I don't know how many people have given a thumbs up!,1
9/6/2018,Awesome learning app. May be they can introduce fees per course instead of paying for subscription every month,5
9/6/2018,There is a WiFi bug. It kept saying wifi needs to be enabled when downloading module but my WiFi is on. Workaround this by disabling/reenabling wifi. I am using Google Pixel and i know that wifi is working because i was able to access Youtube videos. I also ran into issues where i need internet to access the app to watch downloaded videos. This isn't helpful when i am on the plane.,3
9/6/2018,Fantastic app,5
9/5/2018,"Now the problem is solved, and works fine thanks for your quick response",4
9/5/2018,Autoplay only works if I keep the app open. If I switch apps I have to switch back to pluralsight for the next video to play,4
9/4/2018,App is good. But has one major problem. It stops once i go for full screen mode. It does not play at all.,3
9/4/2018,"Excelent app for taking small courses on the ride. I really like it. Use it on the Bus, Subway, Taxi, on the Plane. Love it!",5
9/4/2018,I just love it,5
9/4/2018,"It's saying network problem, I want this app developer to know that there is a network problem..",2
9/2/2018,It's not browsing videos in my phone,1
9/2/2018,Awesome!,5
9/1/2018,"App has improved a lot, but still stalls too frequently. Stalls appear to happen at fixed points in videos. When you have identified it, you can avoid it by skipping ahead a few seconds before past that point. Should be better.",3
8/31/2018,Just Amazing ❤,5
8/31/2018,I can't learn anything from this because once I select any course it's showing please check your internet connection but my internet connection is good,4
8/30/2018,Please make this app fluent every time i try to click on software development courses it says internet connection problem BTW i am using fast 15MBPS,3
8/28/2018,Would be great if this app has a streaming facility to normal smart tv,5
8/27/2018,Best learning app.,5
8/27/2018,Great !,5
8/27/2018,Great job!,5
8/26/2018,Extremely well .. I can suggest this one,5
8/21/2018,I am very disappointed with the pluralsight application as earlier I was authorised to view any courses for 60 days for free but as I was persuing the Angular path...I am stuck in between as everytime I try to access the course videos I receive a popup saying I am not authorised to view this course...,2
8/21/2018,Really adds value to having the membership as you are not locked to only using a browser. Also the download feature makes it worth more as you can view the videos even in a place with low or no connectivity.,5
8/19/2018,Among the very best learning platforms out there. For 35 dollars a month. Insane value.,5
8/18/2018,Awesoem tnx,5
8/15/2018,"The app is great, except for skipping through videos as it will often freeze, you then need to start the video again. Using the skip back/forward 10 secs is more reliable but still causes a freeze sometimes, even if skipping slowly to let it catch up.Very frustrating.",4
8/15/2018,Well worth it!,5
8/15/2018,Really improved great app right now.,4
8/15/2018,Like it,5
8/14/2018,Wish there was a way of reading and making notes per video like the website offers.,3
8/13/2018,"Need video decoder fix, video stuck issue",1
8/13/2018,"Finally, &quot;resume course&quot; option is available.",4
8/13/2018,Updated to 5 stars because of quick response from developer.  Great content. Courses are easy to follow and table of contents makes it easy to track progress.   I would like single tap to play/pause. Double tap to jump forward and back. I can't find mobile subtitles still.,5
8/11/2018,Awesome,5
8/10/2018,Thanks for you,5
8/8/2018,Good app to learn if you are on corporate subscription . Course progress not reflecting after update. Glitches cleared after re-installation.,5
8/8/2018,Great mobile app overall,5
8/7/2018,Nice app. I use it for all my learning offline,5
8/7/2018,The best e-learning app out there!,5
8/6/2018,The app always leads to error,2
8/6/2018,"Confusing access requirement. My organization has provided free access to pluralsight courses. When I come back to a couse I stopped half way, it tells me the course is not included in the plan. Wasted lot of time sorting out access issues than learning. Not better than free courses on YouTube anyways.",1
8/5/2018,There are lots of issue with the app. 1. On continuing with course it starts from begin rather than continuing from where I left the course. 2.In older version full screen mode which used to hide menu in moto phones does not work anymore. I am not sure in which version it stopped working. 3. When you are in the middle of video and you move to landscape mode video starts from beginning. Rather than continuing from where I switched the mode.,2
8/3/2018,"I used a lot of apps like Tree house, Udemy, Udacity, Edx, Coursera and others but none of them provided deep knowledge like plural sight. *The app doesn't have any bugs like Tree house or Udacity. *You can get 2 months free trial. *You can download the courses. *The way instructors teach topics is very good in PS. But in Udemy they teach topics less deeply and also slowly. *If you learn any course you will definitely gain full knowledge on it.",5
8/3/2018,Good app,4
8/3/2018,I love Pluralsight. The content is so accurate. Very nice interface.,5

7/27/2018,Great resource for any it professional.,5
7/27/2018,Nice interface,4
7/26/2018,Each restarting needs to be killed to watch the lessons.,2
7/26/2018,"Use to be good before, but now it just seems to buffer a lot for 4g connection, the connection is more than enough for steaming, still buffers a lot, try improving for the sake of the People who would want to learn on the go.",2
7/26/2018,Fraud behavior.... Charged 40$ without informing,1
7/26/2018,Where is the subtitle option in the app,2
7/25/2018,Please add your app in minimise option like YouTube,5
7/25/2018,Good,5
7/24/2018,Best self study app,5
7/24/2018,Update: it's clearly getting better but more work is needed. Now the app doesn't seem to remember where I have left off. Fix that and I'm a happy camper,3
7/23/2018,"I want to use the app to watch your content offline, but it needs an internet connection to watch it.. realy?! Please provide downloaded content without any internet connection (air plan, train...)!",2
7/23/2018,Good material but some part of it has to be made public for audience who cannot afford to pay,5
7/23/2018,"Great content. Nice option to download and watch when you're offline. The current version does not mark clips as completed with in the app, but the web site does show as completed.",4
7/22/2018,"Would be a decent app if I could use the content I downloaded. Unfortunately, after downloading a course it appears as I hadn't and I'm not able to stream it since the connection isn't good... As far as I can see, I'm not the only one with this issue so please help us change our thoughts and fix these things. Update: also, the course I'm trying to watch on a bad network just got interrupted and now I'm not able to play from the module I was at. It only plays from the first module",1
7/20/2018,Very helpful,5
7/20/2018,"I have fiber optic connection and its really fast, its always buffering for a long time, even in the middle of the video. This is so annoying.",1
7/20/2018,Can't get the rewind and seek to consistently work. Keeps crashing the video playback,2
7/19/2018,Very Great learning path,5
7/19/2018,Good,5
7/19/2018,Buffering and buffering again even though i have a great intenet connection. Sometimes it just restarts the video. Why would you think that is what i need when whatching a 30+ minute video?,1
7/18/2018,I love Pluralsight but this app sucks. Throws errors if you try to download and unable to remember where you got to meaning you have manually find the section each time then pray that it works at all,2
7/17/2018,Have started seeing a no. of issues recently: 1. Not able to download any videos. Keep getting an error ' An unexpected error has occurred ' .There are no issues with the Internet and I tried restarting the app a few times but didn't help 2. While buffering if the Internet signal is weak it stops and starts playing the first chapter of the course. Very frustrating. Can someone fix this asap,3
7/17/2018,"Good content, buggy video player",3
7/16/2018,"My dudes... Why does this app not save my place or show where I am within a course? All it shows is the overall course progress bar and no way to continue that course from where I left off. Even the individual videos have no visual indicator of which ones I have watched. Totes bizzarro, am I out of my noodlerino? EDIT: Has nothing to do with sync; the progress is all made on my phone and it even says &quot;recently synced&quot;. The problem is as I have said the app doesn't offer a way to &quot;continue course&quot; (only &quot;start course&quot;) and the table of contents doesn't indicate which vids have already been watched. But the app clearly is aware of which ones I have watched because the overall course progress indicator is accurate.",2
7/16/2018,The app is not keeping track of progress of the course. It will also lock up sometimes when pausing the course in the background and trying to play it later. Otherwise I like the content.,2
7/14/2018,Great app.,5
7/14/2018,the best,5

7/10/2018,Best learning App,5
7/10/2018,Terrible plain and simple. This player is so very unreliable. Can't believe after all this time they can't make a player that works even at basic level.,1
7/10/2018,The data related courses are redirected to data camp. Some topics recorded have bad audio.,1
7/9/2018,Functional except for downloads. It fails frequently downliading n of nTotal and instead of retrying itself you have to manually start downloading the missing. Repeat until it finally completes.,2

6/20/2018,"I've downloaded a few courses, but whenever I go to watch them during my commute on the tube, after selecting the downloaded course the app just shows the spinner and does nothing.",2
6/18/2018,"Excellent job by pluralsight. I really like all the course. One thing need to be improve is captions background colour in application. It should be transparent. When we fast forward or backward video, video restarted. And Videos title missing sometimes.",2

6/14/2018,"Can't sign in even after authorizing my device, even though I am a premium member.",1
6/14/2018,I was dissapointed on the app. I was expecting that i can register pluralsight through my network provider billing system because i dont have credit card or paypal. Consider of allowing people to register via network provider because most people might not have credit card.,1
6/13/2018,Excellent courses that are just the right balance of content without being too long winded.,5

5/8/2018,"I'm a big fan of Pluralsight but the version of the app for Chromebooks is pants. I cannot seem to pause videos, the only way out is to esc, videos are not auto moving to the next video instead the current time keeps increasing beyond he max, i.e. 4:30/4:15. When going back into the video it starts me back at the one I just watched, unfortunately the button to skip next also isn't working. I then open the course/module view on the right of the playing video to try and go to the video I want, this sometimes works, but not always! Let me know if you need additional info on any of the above if it would help to fix things.",2

4/25/2018,"Beware of the app, the developers have been known to make updates to libraries without checking if they'll work on the version of your OS and when that happens they expect you to buy a new device. So you go from a working version with a bug to a non functioning version.",1

4/25/2018,All my downloaded courses that are stored in the microsd card cannot be read and/or play in my new mobile phone.

4/20/2018,Wow !!! I have watched many courses and continuing my learning. Great place to learn lot of things. You guys are doing really great job. Since I know most of people do not have proper technical foundation during their studies Plural sight gives a complete picture and directs us to learn in a new way. And the examples given by author gives us a confidence to explore into the subject. I really learned alot and liked it very much. Only problem I faced is I cannot download videos into mp4 or other player formats. That would be grateful if we have such option. I am happy to use this app. Will use in future for my learnings. Plural sight should continue adding more and more videos for learners like us. Thank you guys.,5

3/27/2018,Everything is great but would like to view my downloaded courses while offline.At present all downloaded courses could be viewed only in case of internet. This defeats the purpose of downloading the course,4
3/27/2018,Best resource out there for a professional developer's career.,5
3/27/2018,"While loading getting message &quot;There was an error authenticating with the network. If the problem persist please log out and log back in.&quot; But unfortunately this issue persist forever and there is no option to log out as well. The only option left is to clear the app data from settings and log back in, and on doing that I will loose all the downloaded courses. This is happening multiple times in the past month and waisted lot of time as well as data/money. Please fix the bugs in this application asap.",1
3/27/2018,Cool app better it u teach about buffalo Go,5
3/26/2018,I have company account and added my mobile device from the web browser in PluralSight's &quot;my account&quot;-&gt;devices page and it even registered it but still I am unable to sign in.,1
3/25/2018,The app is great but for some reason I am not able to cast the video on my tv. The cast options doesn't work ..hopefully this will be fixed soon,4
3/25/2018,I don't know why the lecture video stops when I switch from portrait to landscape mode.,3
3/25/2018,i am not able to see the paths in home page,1
3/23/2018,Great app,5
3/23/2018,Amazing and I recommend !!,5
3/22/2018,"Great app, does exactly what I need",5
3/22/2018,An awesome learning app. The beauty here is post every topic there is a demo which makes the concepts very clear and interesting. I love it ....,5
3/22/2018,Would be nice to be able to pay monthly subscription through Google Play.,4
3/21/2018,Much improved but navigation is still weirdly flawed. If you click on a bookmark from the home screen you can see a course overview and download the whole course. If you click on bookmarks to see them all then clicking on a course starts it and there's no way to download the entire course. It makes it difficult to have more than two offline courses.,2
3/21/2018,Pathetic app! First learn to manage user session!! Such a disaster app!,1
3/16/2018,Great training site brilliant people doing the training. The app is well designed and easy to navigate.,5
3/14/2018,"I would love this app but it's offline functionality is limited. You can download courses to your phone which is helpful for when I travel by tube, but it needs an internet connection to log you in. So if you forget to connect before you go underground it can leave you very frustrated",3
3/13/2018,Nicely explained and organized..,4
3/11/2018,Understandable explanation,4
3/9/2018,"The course content is so vast. The older courses are still there, so you might want to check the course publishing date. The premium account is worth it.",5
3/8/2018,All trainings that I have taken are good and detailed.,5
3/8/2018,Reply: Then how do you explain that after I go to airplane mode it works with no interruption ? Still has a fixation with network connectivity even though everything I need is already downloaded on the device. Rotating the device looses where I was on the table of contents especially when done while it trying to connect. And no! Turning airplane mode is not funny or a good support recommendation!,1
3/8/2018,Best of the best.,5
3/5/2018,Excellent trainings,5
3/4/2018,"When I click on bookmark on a course, many times it doesn't get selected. Also search functionality is lacking. It doesn't show courses which are searchable through google",4
3/3/2018,A must have app if you want to continue the courses on the go!,5
3/3/2018,The courses are well organised and easy to manage. A great learning experience!!,4
3/2/2018,Pluralsight always keep me updated with latest technology by its excellent videos. Loved it....,5
2/28/2018,"That's great app, as someone pointed out progress synching needs to be better with web application, I can follow course while anywhere if I have mobile it's great",5
2/27/2018,It doesn't sync well with its website but it's extremely useful tool,5
2/27/2018,Good source of learning,5
2/26/2018,One of the best e-learning apps,5
2/26/2018,Great learning platform,5
2/25/2018,The website is far more better than the app.,3
2/24/2018,"In mobile , the course videos doesn't load in landscape view , in portrait mode the video player is to small and the course catalogue is bigger one. Resolving this would definitely add one more star",4
2/23/2018,Pluralsight is a fantastic app for professionals like me to learn new and advanced technical skills to help apply and try new things. Really impressed with the collections of topic and great teachers covering the topics. Wonderful app to use and invest time...!!!,5
2/22/2018,It'd be great if captions were available offline.,4
2/20/2018,"Extremely powerfull source of educational materials about Programming, Security, Design, Management, Architect, etc... Love it!",5
2/19/2018,Awesome content,5
2/19/2018,Great content. Excellent teachers. And an amazing app! Good work:),5
2/18/2018,"When I've downloaded a course, next time even if I'm connected to the internet, it must fetch from the download file and downloads must ask an option to choose to have captions",4
2/18/2018,Awesome app best in the world,5
2/17/2018,Good app for learning.,5
2/16/2018,"Great App. Earlier had an issue with Captions on my mobile. It's resolved now. Captions toggle without any issue.  Would appreciate if the transcript can also be segregated with headings mapping to each video, rather than each module.  Kudos to Pluralsight team.",5
2/15/2018,"Nowadays many phones have OLED displays with 2:1 aspect ratio. Watching video leaves unused grey space on the sides. Would be nice to completely black it out to prevent screen burn-in and probably also implement &quot;punch in&quot;.  P.S. Resource content is good, saved me several times.",3
2/15/2018,Excellent. Content is superb. The app is flawless and casting to Chromecast is nice. A must for any professional.,5
2/15/2018,Used on my Galaxy for a while. Now using on my Chromebook. Works great.,5
2/13/2018,Where is my path session? It's gone!,4
2/13/2018,"When You have WiFi it works well, otherwise on mobile network useless. Downloaded clips are not working without network connection, really awkward. Using the webapp instead.",3
2/12/2018,Great resource for learning and improving tech skills,5
2/12/2018,One question Where is video quality settings I cant find it,5
2/11/2018,"Second follow-up: Still 5 stars, thanks for adding playback speed while casting! ----------------------------- First follow-up: Updated to 5 stars, casting issue fixed! Now I just wish I could control playback speed while casting.  -----------------------------  Original review: Terrific content.  4 stars only because of inability to cast.  Says it is connected and displays Pluralsight splash image, but will not play any videos.",5
2/11/2018,"I am currently studying for CASP and despite the smaller screen on the phone, I am finding it easier to study without the distraction of games on the computer. The application is very well made and user friendly. Now depending on if I pass or not I may come back and edit this review based on content",4
2/10/2018,"One major issue I am facing is when the phone orientation changes horizontal to vertical or vice versa , video stops suddenly .  I need to go back to previous/next video and come back again to this clip manually seek to the position I left of. I have a paid subscription with my other email id and with that also I facing the same issue.",3
2/9/2018,Grt courses.. little higher priced.would have gone for full membership  if priced a little cheaper,5
2/9/2018,"I have problem when i watch my offline course. This problem happens when i take subway. As the tain goes in and out of underground tunnels, the data and signal are on and off. During this transition, if i am finished watching one course amd moving to the next couse, my screen kepton loading staus. Unless i turned off my data, i cant continue watching my next course.",3
2/8/2018,Best application for it pros. 👍,5
2/7/2018,Awesome.,5
2/7/2018,best educational app ever! kudos to the team,5
2/4/2018,You can learn from basics.,4
2/4/2018,Good platform for learn and explore,5
2/3/2018,Issues with casting it to a Chromecast but they reached out to me with questions about it right away which I found impressive.,5
2/3/2018,Updated app is great. Love the ability to navigate course modules while video plays in background (not possible on iOS).   However the inability to increase the video play speed is a serious usability issue. I hope this feature is top priority for the dev team.,5
2/1/2018,Very useful app,5
2/1/2018,Great content. Pluralsight is awesome but the app is not quite streamlined. Forgets where you are in a video. Resets video on screen rotation. Resets speed settings. Basically a lot of redoing required. I must say that it's not a deal breaker.,4
1/31/2018,App is good. The only problem that I face is while downloading the videos to see offline. The notification for download stay there on the notification center and does not get removed. The only option available is to  disable the notification for plural sight. my android version is 7.0. one more thing one my windows mobile the add does not work at all.,5
1/31/2018,good tutors should add more content,4
1/30/2018,"Pluralsight is a fantastic company with a lot of training material for anyone of an experience level in IT. The app is easy to navigate with fantastic functionality (note taking, course bookmarks, etc).  The app is easy to navigate. 100% worth the investment.",5
1/30/2018,"All I get is &quot;Checking permissions...&quot; UPDATE: It's definitely better than the last time I used it but the video streaming, buffering and caching is really poor - if you're on the move, it almost never plays smoothly. As a subscriber, it's very frustrating because I seldom use the web viewer. 😓",2
1/28/2018,Awesom app for learning & growing,5
1/27/2018,Its a great app to develop our technical skills,5
1/26/2018,"This is a great app. Sometimes the progress between the app and the website are out of sync and I can't get the downloads working right, but other than that I think it is great and Pluralsight is awesome.",4
1/26/2018,Very nice content on the app,5
1/26/2018,"Love the content. Thought if you download content and try to play it with low signal, the content takes ages to load, and connection errors come up.",4
1/25/2018,Good to support chromecast. Unable to pause or cancel download. Table of contents gets closed when scrolling down. Restarts the module when rotating the screen. The app is not as good as the content is.,4
1/24/2018,The application doesn't support notes. The evolution of this app and website app are very different. I wish the same evolution.,3
1/23/2018,So helpful!,5
1/23/2018,"I use a few training apps and sites.  I don't think any of them are weak, but I love pluralsight.   The interface is clean and easy to follow. The courses are good and there is lots of content for the area's I am interested in.  I do advise it to my friends and family.",5
1/23/2018,"Lot of bugs, but the content is very good",3
1/23/2018,Very good platform for Learn Coding..,5
1/23/2018,I want to give a 5 star for the content. But I am a paid subscriber and regularly. You offline videos require internet. I'm constantly traveling and this issue is why I have started using Udemy more.,2
1/22/2018,"Chromecast notification disappears. Reopening the app, forces video that is casted to TV, to be restarted from beginning. OP3 Android 8",3
1/22/2018,It requires an Internet connection to watch offline videos.,1
1/21/2018,Doesn't let me sign in to the app with username or email. However Im able to login using the web browser,1
1/20/2018,Best Platform Ever!,5
1/20/2018,Love the content,5
1/18/2018,Excellent resource.,5
1/18/2018,"App consistently doesn't work very well when chromecasting. After playing a couple of videos, it stops and doesn't continue to play the next video. Selecting the next video, or the play button does nothing. I have to stop casting, then start casting again to get it to continue to work.",2
1/18/2018,Great app. Congrats for your hard work.,5
1/17/2018,Amazing experience.,5
1/14/2018,"Good app, would like support for Nvidia Shield TV (I know I can chrome cast but a native app is always better). The courses are very good and the instructors are very knowledgeable about the subjects.",4
1/14/2018,"Excellent contents... Only issue is with the offline videos not synching, even though connected to internet. Please fix this ASAP",5
1/13/2018,Very good content with great explanation.,5
1/12/2018,Great content,5
1/12/2018,Number of items showed after search never matches the list shown. Filter hardly works. 👎👎👎,5
1/11/2018,"Content is great. I love the video player for the fact that is has speed controls, notes, bookmarks, and easy navigation. The app also casts to Chromecast which is a major plus!",5
1/10/2018,"This is an app that can show you instructional videos on many topics, including a lot of IT topics. The videos are usually excellent but the app uses a large amount of storage and it cannot be stored on an SD card. Why? Every other similar paid subscription app I use that stores that much data can be run from the much less costly and much larger SD storage. Edit: The developer recommends changing settings in the app to store future content on the SD card. This does not move current content out of main storage, and it is using a different method than other Android apps on my phone to move to SD storage. Unless I delete all my current content and download it all again, not a solution.",2
1/10/2018,Awsome!!! 😊,5
1/10/2018,It's a Good app but for offline video also requires internet connectivity for each clip this is really annoying,3
1/9/2018,It seems downloaded courses are working after the latest update .thanks for the reply and quick fix .,5
1/9/2018,This got better through out the years,5
1/9/2018,Great App. Can you make the videos go full screen size i.e even home buttons should auto hide just like youtube,4
1/9/2018,An awesome app. Works smoothly and consumes acceptable amount of data for such type of content. And the library of courses is pretty rich.,5
1/9/2018,Excellent application... Still I can suggest some improvements.. 1.Screen rotation on mobile pause the video and it doesn't play anymore..this happens with both online and offline modes.. 2. Mobile application dashboard is not that user friendly,4
1/9/2018,Nice and easy to use. A pain you need to be online to view the downloaded files.,5
1/8/2018,Very nice app and equally nice content. Covers all the important concepts with sufficient details to get you going.,5
1/8/2018,"Nicely designed app, but when I leave a downloaded video paused it crashes my phone.",3
1/8/2018,"Great tool when you are connected to the Internet but can be a swine when trying to view downloaded data. I think it has it's own definition of downloaded, it will say downloaded but complain you have no connection when you attempt to view it. A pain for long trips where you are offline.",4
1/7/2018,Superb,5
1/4/2018,"If I don't use the app for a while say week or two and then try to view the downloaded content offline, then the app won't let me access it. I would have to get connected to data before accessing, which is quite annoying especially when you want to view it on a long flight. Secondly the search doesn't work properly, if I search with a query and search with another query and if I want to search again with the first query then I am unable to do so, it won't show me any results.",2
1/4/2018,"The content is good, but the offline functionality is so buggy! I couldn't play any videos when I'm out of network...",2
1/2/2018,"The Download option doesn't work, can't download any courses or modules for offline viewing. Right after clicking on Download it says Downloaded but nothing happens.  Update: the support team has released a fix which sorted the problem and the download option works fine now so re-rating to 5* as it's perfect now.",5
1/2/2018,Love Pluralsight. The whole website.,5
1/1/2018,"Great app, very handy. It needs to support running and storing on micro SD.",3

12/24/2017,Fantastic app for technical development,5
12/23/2017,Can you plan courses like udemy,5
12/23/2017,Great App. I would suggest authors to use larger font size for editors as most people watch courses on mobile devices.,5

12/11/2017,One extreamy annoying bug... When video is playing and screen changes orientation the video has to start over. Cannot wait to see this one fixed. All other issues are not noticeable or insignificant. Well done app! Thanks a lot!      It makes entire service work for me only in the context of mobile learning!,5

I use this mostly when commuting, making dinner etc. Almost all the time, the app stops playback between segments and will only resume when phone is unlocked.

10/22/2017,"I downloaded a course and was able to listen while driving home, that was nice. Then at my house, I attempted to resume the downloaded course, and received an error telling me to check my internet connection and try again. Well, I'm posting this negative review from my phone, so if that works, then we'll know it was pluralsight that prevented me from viewing the course I already downloaded, not my internet connection. Say, why do I need an internet connection in order to view an already downloaded course anyway?",1
10/22/2017,Super useful,5
10/21/2017,Courses are great . But offline download with app takes ages to complete .,3

10/12/2017,Excellent online training portal. Authors are great subject matter experts.,4
10/12/2017,At least try it. Can't believe I'm leaving a review but this app and service is really beyond my best aspiration for it. I can't even use it to its fullest. I want to learn new things and try making my own apps because they have such detailed courses. They even have authors from other online schools do videos and explain their talents. Love it.,5
10/11/2017,Solid app,4
10/11/2017,"I ran into problems where it would freeze for credentials but after reinstalling, it worked fine.",5

10/2/2017,Nice performance and to the point.,5
10/2/2017,auch a waste.... you can't play offline the videos you download. it would be perfect for airplane trips etc when you wish to spend your time and been educated. but without internet the app is useless.,1
10/2/2017,This is a must have if you work in IT.,5
10/2/2017,It's to good,4

9/24/2017,"Excellent app with excellent learning materials.  Top notch authors and instructors, including some of the top professionals in their respective industries.",5
9/23/2017,Freezes constantly. Most of the time you pause it you have to memorize where you are in the video since it usually won't unpause and you have to start over. Added a star for the nice GUI.,2

9/20/2017,Added device got removed after updating,1
9/19/2017,"It's a good app in general terms, it has some issues but it worth the subscription fee, I only use it for quick reviews or training on the go, for more in depth I recommend the web site",5
9/18/2017,Excellent web dev content.,5
9/17/2017,Does not play well with Chromecast,2
9/17/2017,"When watching on Chromecast, the app typically doesn't update to reflect my completion progress within the table of contents.  If I have to stop watching and resume later, I can't tell where I left off which is pretty frustrating.",3
9/17/2017,I started a free trial I wanna know about certain course whether the lectures are good or not and that certain course was not available in trial period like how I am I supposed to buy the premium pack if I don't get to know whether lectures are good or not,1
9/15/2017,Does pluralsight offer complete offline courses - including videos?,4
9/14/2017,Everything looks good except one issue which I am facing very frequently.It gives an error saying  connection timed out when one chapter is completed and moving on to next chapter,4
9/13/2017,Rubbish,1
9/11/2017,Nice,5
9/11/2017,Awesome,5
9/11/2017,I have paid account but when I tried to download the course over its bit slow. Why not it's allowing us download based on my internet speed.,4
9/11/2017,This thing just changed my career.,5
9/10/2017,Great topics and training!,5
9/10/2017,Our company is currently on trial for pluralsight. Tried this app and most of the time its not responding properly. This happens when you pause the video and return back.,2
9/10/2017,Simply great.,5
9/9/2017,It doesn't remember the position or play rate and it starts randomly playing in my pocket when the app wasn't even in the notification screen,1

9/3/2017,"Excellent app, as a side note if it could cast to my Lg TV smart TV that would be great.",5
9/2/2017,A vry cooool sight to learn new things...,5
9/1/2017,Good learning experience,5
9/1/2017,Best tutorial sessions with all types like from beginner to advanced. Very helpful if you want to learn some new technology or update the known one,5
8/31/2017,"After recent update, app is not responding properly.",2
8/31/2017,"Great app, but i cannot share the screen though.",4
8/31/2017,The technical content that pluralsight provides is amazing. The software that you have to use to get it is pretty poor. I have to restart the app every single time I use it. Any time you hit pause it becomes confused. The crummy software takes away from the amazing material that they provide. They should really rewrite this entire thing. They need to up their game significantly,3
8/30/2017,Cool and informative,5
8/30/2017,Great app. Allows me to download courses to watch offline viewing a long commute.,5
8/28/2017,Contents are superb,5
8/27/2017,Awesome mentors,5
8/27/2017,"It needs better handing of loss of connection. When connection to a WiFi network is lost, the video has to be restarted from the chapter view. In such case continuing from entering I left off is not possible and I have to manually find the exact moment I was at. This slows down learning on the mobile platform.",4
8/26/2017,This is an awesome app full of useful content. The only thing it's missing is the fire tv support. I had two damn fire tvs and I cannot cast the videos to them.,4
8/24/2017,"Has a very annoying bug: when casting to my TV and progressing through courses, the progress bar doesn't move even though next videos are played. Very annoying as i then need to click on those videos to mark them as complete.",3
8/23/2017,Very good,5
8/22/2017,Loved it,5
8/21/2017,Perfect place to learn technology.....keep up the good work,5

8/19/2017,I love Pluralsight! Period.,5
8/18/2017,Really good :),5
8/17/2017,This app just doesn't work right on Android N on my moto g4 plus. Countless number of bugs which i can document and mail. Do not waste your subscription on this. Do not go by brand.,1
8/17/2017,This is a nice app where you can watch your tutorial videos on your phone. It supports Chromecast too so you can watch the videos directly on TV. There are some bugs in Chromecast implementation though e.g. 1 video plays and then the next one starts on the TV but the app on phone still keeps showing the old videos is in progress and does not put a green tick on the previous video. The title of the old video is shown but the timeline is from the new video.,4
8/16/2017,Is it possible to save plurasight videos to SD Card,4
8/15/2017,works perfect!,5
8/13/2017,Fine,4
8/13/2017,"Super app, which helps us learn from basic to advanced",5
8/12/2017,good app but it freezes when i navigate between lectures,2
8/11/2017,Very helpful. Well worth the investment. I appreciate that new courses are uploaded almost daily. A recommendation: mark old courses as outdated if they are outdated.,5
8/10/2017,"Great app ,good to get knowledge of new and  old technologies",5
8/9/2017,"Negative feedback is only to highlight my issue. Whenever its going to next video , app gets freeze and I have to close the app.",2
8/8/2017,"Good stable application with great features and solid video streaming. Simple interface, and out of your way UI. It seem to be continuesly improve, I used this app almost daily for courses or one off research.",5

8/8/2017,Thanks,5
8/6/2017,Very good application,5
8/5/2017,Nice !!👍,5
8/3/2017,"There is no option to choose for video quality. Even on mobile data, I need to stream HD videos. And after every 30 mins of continuous watching, device is shutting down automatically. I'm am using Moto G4 plus.",3
8/2/2017,Liked it,4
8/1/2017,Everything about it is great... the only thing I would love to see in the future is paths and tracks like treehouse. Sorting courses from all of pluralsight into one track/path.,4
7/29/2017,"3 years after first use, it's so much better! Smooth experience. Not tried Chromecast yet.",1
7/27/2017,Chromecast player doesn't support play speed modifications. Would be 5/5 otherwise. Some authors have very slow speaking styles.,5
7/27/2017,informative,5
7/26/2017,Had issues with Chromecast support but suddenly I realised today that it works fine now. ☺️,5

7/22/2017,Awwwwwwsome. Love you guys.,5
7/20/2017,"Overall the app is just fine, but I find it impossible to edit unless I Force Stop it. Else if I exit, it keeps coming up in my notifications no matter how much I try and close it... pretty annoying",2
7/19/2017,Excellent,5
7/18/2017,Google Chromecast support?,4
7/18/2017,What to do in order to sign in ..there is a no option for sign up,3
7/18/2017,It's very good site to learn,5
7/18/2017,Awesome app,5
7/17/2017,It's amazing,5
7/15/2017,"The average rating doesn't reflect the true picture now.  UPDATE: Guys, as much as I love this application, there really is an area which can use some fixing. I am still rating it five because I don't like it's below 4 right now and that's just not right.   The sync feature just doesn't work well with the offline videos. If I watch a module totally offline, when I go live on the desktop, it just doesn't show up in my history. Even though I was connected to the Internet while watching the videos offline, it just doesn't sync. Then I have to watch a second or two of each video I have already watched offline just so everything's in sync.   There's one more thing and though it's a non-issue for me, I just want to lay it out here for feedback purposes. If I switch from pluralsight full-screen mode to some other app and then switch back there's no video, just audio. To get around, one can exit full-screen mode and then again go full-screen. It obviously doesn't bother me much but I am sure the devs would want to fix everything, big impact or not.",5
7/14/2017,Awesome App for learning,4
7/13/2017,Must have to learn while on the go...,5
7/13/2017,Hangs so many times.,2

7/11/2017,"Content is good, but android app poor and cooperation with Chromecast ver poor. Just trying to start a course, 30 mins lost and still no luck.",2
7/11/2017,It is absolute amazing. Just love it. Thank you Pluralsight.,5
7/10/2017,Mostly great content. Best value tech training I have come across.,4
7/9/2017,"Great site, cool resource, awesome app!",5
7/8/2017,"It improved something but there's problems which don't make it useable. If I switch to another app while fullscreen playing a video and I go back to it, video is lost. I have to close the app completely. If I click next too fast my phone almost freeze and I had to force stop the app and reload it. It was showing a black screen. Really not the best, coming for a company working on the technology niche it is disappointing",2
7/7/2017,Amazing content breath and depth.,5
7/7/2017,Nice & I improve myself​,4
7/7/2017,I was able to install this application in my Android TV (Sony BRAVIA 2015) through play store. but it was not showing in apps list and was unable to launch. It will be very useful if this app supported in TV too.,4
7/6/2017,So good Very nice app,5
7/4/2017,Top app for online learning. It has great content. For me it's also important the offline capability to listen content when travelling.,5
7/4/2017,"Navigation could be more smooth. Also, sometimes the UI feels a bit cluttered. But overall, a well designed app.",4
7/4/2017,Cool,5
6/29/2017,The ease of use and the nice layout of the app is excellent.,5
6/28/2017,A go to application for self learning,5
6/28/2017,I've always liked pluralsight courses and this makes it easy to watch courses wherever I am. The one thing I didn't like was the skip that happens when changing the orientation of the device. Other than that I highly recommend this app if you have an account.,4
6/27/2017,Best IT Digital Ref,5
6/26/2017,Has some really good contents for quick overview.,5
6/25/2017,Love it,5

6/25/2017,It's really nice app for those who  trying to get update in Software,4
6/24/2017,cast simply does not work,1
6/23/2017,Edit: 6 months later cast not working on Pixel XL to ChromeCast Ultra.  De & Re doesn't fix...  Inconvenient content...  {De & Re fixed ChromeCast issue in Pixel....  Will not auto-advance when casting and phone locks.}. Content you have to fight to view on anything other than a PC-based browser...  Wouldn't cast from Pixel XL to current ChromeCast...reinstall to corrected though.,1
6/23/2017,pluralsight is the best definitely better than lynda,5
6/23/2017,I cannot play the videos in this application. always prompting &quot;stop working&quot;. I hope they will address this issue.,1

6/13/2017,Love this app,5
6/12/2017,Lot of stuffs to learn...,5
6/12/2017,"This is a paid-for app. so I expect it to work. £25 per month. So I expect it to work well. When I download a course at lunchtime at work when I'm online, I expect to be able to access it on the train when I'm offline. Unfortunately, this aspect is badly broken in this app. It works intermittently. You have to sign in again sometimes for no apparent reason, sometimes if you've rebooted your device and for that you have to be online.  I've lost LOADS of possible learning time to this and to be honest, the a support people don' t care. There's no indication that they will fix it.",1
6/10/2017,Exellent resourses!,4
6/8/2017,Big fan of pluralsight..,5
6/6/2017,"Like it, but seems to crash occasionally/freeze when navigating from a video",1

6/6/2017,Great app. But I need a connection every time that I try to watch an offline content (downloaded).,4

5/29/2017,Simon Allardice and company are the absolute best for teaching fundamentals of programming.  Absolutely stellar!,5
5/28/2017,"App is very good. You can also download course for offline viewing. One request to developers, it's great benefit if you can allow app to store downloaded course data to external storage. Currently it stores data to internal storage which is limited. Thanks.",4
5/28/2017,Better Way to be a master in your loved technology,5
5/27/2017,I highly recommend Pluralsight. Their courseware sets the bar & the app is excellent.  I can jump right back in from where I  left off  on any device seamlessly.,5
5/26/2017,Awesome Content and great interface,5
5/25/2017,"The app is really bad, it is really slow. I use this app in android and ios and the app is not fluent. It is really hard to slice the menus &quot;continue viewing&quot; or &quot;bookmarks&quot; among others. I am always motivated to learn something before using this app, but after few minutes on pluralsight, i just quit and go somewhere else. Some years ago, this app was really good. Probably now, you should take some pluralsight courses on how to build good apps.",1
5/25/2017,Chromecast simply does not work,1
5/24/2017,"Chrome cast issues are there, please fix  Edit: Details sent over mail as requested. Thanks for quick response.",4
5/24/2017,It is great app... but need to enhance the progress synchronization,4
5/24/2017,"I love Pluralsight as a service and it is well worth the money, however being able to Chromecast from my phone is a huge selling point, as I don't have to have my PC on for hours at a time just to stream video to my TV. That being said, the  Chromecast feature doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy S6 running Android 7.0. The logo comes up and it says that it is casting but that's as fat as it gets. It's similar to what happened when I used to use a proxy to try casting a TV website from the UK, while living in Germany.",3
5/23/2017,Pretty good,5
5/23/2017,Great paths for learning very specific skills.,5

5/12/2017,Its really great.,4
5/12/2017,"The app is pretty basic, a few extra features would make it worth while over a in browser experience. Adding Chromecast would be one. Also the screen always rotates even if I have it turned off, its really frustrating. My rating would be higher if it wasn't the case.",4

5/4/2017,Nice,5
5/3/2017,Its better. Still phones home on a downloaded course when am on the train which is a pain and needs to be fixed. Nice feature to download to sd. As I lost plenty of my paid subscription due to bugs I can't forgive easily.  Still it is getting better.  Even fixed the rotate screen and invisible controls issue.,3

4/25/2017,"In general this is a great app, and the playback works well (unlike others I have no problem skipping or seeking on Chromecast). However, when using Chromecast there is no speed or volume control(!). This means I won't use the feature at all, instead I cast my screen to my TV (which uses A LOT of power). Fix this, and I will give it 5 stars.",4
4/25/2017,"Been a while since i used it, now i can't see video. Only sound comes through. Seems to be a codec issue. Please fix.  Update:  It was temporary. A couple restarts and it worked. Please update for better stability.",4
4/23/2017,Amazing,5
4/22/2017,Aweful video seek and Chromecast support. Seek doesn't work while casting and the video unexpectedly pauses every 5-10 minutes. Jumping to the next chapter fixes it and the video starts playing but getting back to where I was is hard due to the seeking issue I mentioned earlier. Plz sort this out. I want to watch the courses on my TV without my laptop.,2

4/9/2017,Good aap,5
4/8/2017,Great app,5
4/8/2017,All is well ...good content ...good authors ...but some issue in mobile app....with video Player like others mentioned,5
4/7/2017,I enjoy their content which is helpful,4
4/6/2017,Very happy with the app and content. One issue I have had is that if I receive a notification while in a video the notification sound plays and then the audio from the course will halve until I close the app or the next notification comes in.,5
4/6/2017,Nice app and content. I wish if the mobile app video issue could be fixed. If we switch yo any other app and then resume the video it show the black screen but sound keep on playing.,4
4/5/2017,Really helped me.,5
4/4/2017,"Generally good content, would be great to have summary notes on key points so i don't need to take notes or rewatch everything to review. Now for bad: 1) I use WiFi tablet on the go, due to screen size and storage, but pluralsight forces to have connection to see offline downloaded content - that's so backwards! When i went on trip i couldn't access learning content on plane or hotel! You know our subscription dates, just save that to the app rather than need online authentication! 2) Another gripe is app switching causes audio to continue, and no way to turn off. This means i have to keep going back to pause video. 3) last is course resuming, it never goes back to where you left off. So every time i watch i need to go frantically remember the last but i was looking at. So good and bad. I'm an elearning us guy, so keen to have these things fixed!",4
4/4/2017,The courses here are comprehensive and help variety of target audience.,4
4/4/2017,"5 star for course content. But 3 star for mobile application. Not working as expected. When I pause video and start again, it always start with black screen with audio.",4
4/4/2017,Bad user experience. I can't even preview any course unless you subscribe blindly.,1
4/3/2017,This is my new Game,5
4/2/2017,Everything works fine.,5
4/1/2017,"App works faultlessly.  Great way to access the content offline on the daily commute.  Pluralsight courses are high quality, current, and work well in this mode. Love being able to play at different rates.",5
3/30/2017,This app has some issues...on the app I can't seem to access path ways to a course but on a desktop computers I can easily please can someone fix it?,2

3/25/2017,"The app looks great, but there is a BIG problem! When I start a video, the whole video is black... Can you please help me, I love pluralsight it helped me a lot.",2
3/24/2017,A really frustrating app. In offline mode the software will require an internet connection to login to watch the content you have downloaded to play in offline mode. The last several versions of this software have been an embarrassment for Microsoft.,1
3/23/2017,Tons of content and all in high quality!,5
3/20/2017,Helped to elevate my skill from complete beginner to advanced programmer. Already recommended this site to so many people that i cant count :),5

3/12/2017,"Can't find test module. I want to take sample test/quiz on the go, it doesn’t  seem to be included with the mobile app.",3
3/11/2017,Great app. When I changed storage location from internal storage to external I was expecting app to copy already downloaded videos but it didn't. App did warn me about missing clips which I downloaded again. Is there anything you can do?,5
3/11/2017,support download to SD card,4
3/10/2017,Much better these days. Thanks,5
3/10/2017,Though knowledge should be for free!!! It is a very good investment with Pluralsight!!!,5

When connected to a vpn it says that I am not authorised to access even my downloaded files. Notification bar DOES NOT disappears after dismissing it when app is not open,2
2/19/2017,"Update: Updated apps provides some form of indications if a course has been downloaded successfully or where was it stopped at. Not perfect but at least an improvement. Notice that one may still have problem to download a whole course in one go, depending on the device usage.",3
2/19/2017,"This is a beautifully designed app and the plualsight database is impressive. If you are a creative professional or is a must as they have extensive courses on Adobe, blender, Maya, Autocad, and many more in all technical fields such as programing, IT, productivity apps and more",5

2/12/2017,"This is a great app and the pc site integrates with pretty much any device. Well worth it for some who can't study just from books like me. The offer, video, work alongside, codes school and defined paths against your knowledge.",5

2/5/2017,Downloading videos for offline use is a bit of a nightmare. The download stops regularly (but the status is still 'downloading') so I have to cancel the download and resume to continue downloading. Happens every 1-2 videos. I'm on a stable internet connection with plenty of space available.   Device: OnePlus 3T with Nougat.,3

1/31/2017,Thanks!!! Nice app. Good for developers...,4
1/31/2017,The app was fine except it didn't have complete fullscreen on Xperia Z. The back and home buttons would still pop up when in fullscreen mode. But now the latest update has completely ruined the app. No more video feed when going fullscreen and it also stutters. It was working perfectly fine before the last update. Please don't push broken updates onto the app especially when we pay 30$ a month for it. Edit: It is working fine now after another update. But the fullscreen is still not fixed.,3

1/13/2017,Love,5
1/12/2017,"It's a really good app, and the best part is the download capability that lets me watch videos offline, while I'm on the move. The download mechanism used to be better and I could download clips individually, but now it's just available on module and course level. Also after the upgrade, the download indicator doesn't show the progress as good as before.",4

1/2/2017,The app has a poor user experience. The player is endlessly buggy and the app stays in the notification treat forever. Even when you dismiss the app. I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. I know I definitely don't want it to happen...,2

12/17/2016,"On my Samsung Tab A running Android 6.0.1, after selecting full screen, it's impossible to come out of full screen in landscape without going back. Results in losing where I was in the video and goes back to course contents. Works fine if I don't press full screen, screen goes full tablet in landscape anyway, or if the video advances to the next one if I've mistakenly selected full screen. I also can't test my progress in a Path quiz on the app. Otherwise it's really great. Clearly a lot of moving parts.",4
12/17/2016,Please add lock button on player. It will prevent from accidentally forward or backward of video.,3

I'm really disappointed watching new versions of this app. :(",1

12/1/2016,Excellent teaching and great content suits all levels.,5
12/1/2016,There's tons of great content on the site. You can spend months browsing courses without getting bored. But they need to do a better job in marking things as depricated.

11/28/2016,Pluralsight on tablets has several playback issues when you pause and your tablet goes to sleep.  Power back on and video won't progress but you can hear the audio.  Some times the screen goes black when you try to hit play after a pause.  Pluralsight the service is great love the year or month model vs buy the video.  Wow a developer that responds thank you and disabling vlc player made it work like it does on my phone it can now resume after power with out having to switch videos and then switch back to.,4

11/22/2016,Only resumes at the start of a video and have to back out of video to resume.,2
11/21/2016,The app is getting better with time. Unfortunately the speed control fails when casting the videos to a chromecast dongle and there's no option for subtitles.,3
11/19/2016,App does not follow play list order if you skip some clips. And 2.4.40 version was better than current 2.4.44 version.,3
11/19/2016,This is about the app and not pluralsight in general. But the app keeps singing me out; it doesn't all me to start playing a video and then go back to searching with the vid/audio continuing; you also can't book mark courses from the search screen; it needs to save the playback speed between sessions; lastly there is quite a bit of pausing between videos (it should prepare buffer),2

11/10/2016,"This app flip flops back and forth between working and not working, with the main issue being audio pops and skips. Oddly enough you can play the same video files just fine from the cache with mxplayer, but really I shouldn't have to. This is the third time I've revised my review because they fixed it before and now broke it again. This issue effects multiple devices HTC ONE m8, and Nexus 7 for me both pop and skip. Revision 4, now login doesn't even work, just sits doing nothing. Edit: Rev 5, another year later and still regularly broken. Authorized device regularly asked for login when offline, when online new courses list just spins and never shows anything.",1
11/9/2016,The overhaul addressed a number of my grievances. Kudos! The app experience on the whole is much improved.,5
11/9/2016,"Love the content, though when I try to watch videos on the app it seems to skip some module sections, e.g. straight from intro to summary and skipping in between",2
11/8/2016,Speed control does not work when chromecasting,4
11/8/2016,Updates  my profile and  does all normal things except the glitch how it doesn't  show some modules and bookmarks fix it to get a 5!,4
11/7/2016,"Good on-the-go app. I found that when using the vlc player I can't go back to the courses listing once I start playing a video. The back button or arrow just minimises the app,  so I have to force stop the app from my phone settings.",3
11/6/2016,"The courses are not working in the latest update, it keeps loading with no results. It's only working through browser.",3
11/6/2016,"Tried it out since it was free with MSN from work.  Loved the content since it's straight to the point.  But still like the CBT nuggets humor.  I mix this with other content and passed the certs easy.  As far as the app goes,  I'm happy with it.",4
11/6/2016,A lot better now.,4
11/5/2016,"This app has promise, but right now I'd call it garbage.  The only reason I wanted a mobile Pluralsight app is so that I can isolate myself in some far-away place and study.  Unfortunately, the offline support is pretty terrible.  Time and time again, I've downloaded content for offline viewing, and then when I find some peaceful, away-from-it-all place to view it, I can't – because the app wants me to sign in, over and over again!  Unfortunately, I'm offline, so I can't, and my plans are dashed.  Mark my words: the first time you try to study on an airplane, you'll discover the same disappointment.",1
11/5/2016,This is a buggy dumpster fire.  Was watching a video earlier in the day and it started playing same video at 2 am while I was sleeping. Woke my wife and I up.,1
11/3/2016,"This app is great. Now that we can save videos for future viewing, it's even better.",5
11/3/2016,"I love the way you deliver the contents, it plays well in my coolpad note3 over wifi, only concern is, it's loosing course  in progress and starts all over again, thanks for keeping bookmarks safe.",5
11/2/2016,"Like it so much but on my iphone only. On my HTC butterfly 2 it's apparently not compatible to android 6, I cannot login to my company account, it just keeps saying invalid username or password. And when I use the Authorise Device, the Generate New Code button doesn't do anything, no code generated at all!  Updated: The problem is solved. The &quot;Butterfly&quot; keyword caused some confusion over the User Agent. 5 stars for the Dev and Support teams.",5
11/2/2016,Very helpful,5
11/1/2016,"I had to remove this from my Asus Nexus 7 v2. It was just clobbering the battery, even when I hadn't opened the app in days and power cycled the tablet a coupla times.",2
10/31/2016,"For such a big online company it is a very bad app. It is always loosing my bookmarks.  After I authorize the device it keep all the time asking me for my password to login. Can you please hire a developer to fix this?  -------------------------------------  No I am not using an old version. You know you can do better than this. You have the resources to be the best in the market, what are you waiting for? Your site is very good, your app is not even close",1
10/30/2016,Very good tutorial,5
10/30/2016,Crashes skips clips all the time,2
10/29/2016,"This app is getting better every day. Although bugs still there, like downloading on unstable connection always interrupts, it's heavily improved during last year.",4
10/28/2016,"The application has been much improved since my original review. It's gone from unusable to very good but still has one or two minor glitches when using with Chromecast. One issue is the app displaying the wrong time line for the currently playing clip, the time line appears to be locked at the length of the clip you originally selected and doesn't update when the next clip is loaded. Another issue was with loading the next clip, it jumped several clips before resuming, marking unviewed clips as viewed.",4
10/28/2016,Great,5
10/27/2016,i love the app and helps me learning.  but the offline viewing is not working. i try to download and it says download is not available under current subscription.  i have subscribed under monthly package in plus category.  please help,4
10/26/2016,Ultimate. I am learning quicker these days.,5
10/26/2016,Half the time when I want to watch a course offline it does not work because there is no offline login. Variable playback speed is good but the button to jump 10s ahead is missing. Much better on iPad.,2
10/26/2016,Until this app keeps making me download the same course all over again because my files are missing for the 5th time,2
10/25/2016,"Great UI and content is well-done, but the app crashes frequently and my Mac has had problems with website as well, not sure if it's on my end but the frequency seems unprecedented.",4
10/25/2016,I'm so disappointed with this app.  Poor management of video quality based on network speed is not there..Also takes too much time to stream.... A loooong way to a perfect app ..,2
10/24/2016,Pluralsight has improved so much over the last couple of years. Love the paths now help to focus training instead of the mad dash for new courses.,5
10/22/2016,This is an awesome app for people looking to take a deep dive into programming!!! I'm lovin it!!!,5
10/21/2016,I actually loved it,5
10/20/2016,Downloading and streaming content doesn't work on Mobile Data,3
10/20/2016,"Awesome app ,good content",5
10/20/2016,Gud,5
10/19/2016,Like the new app!,5
10/18/2016,A very best source for developers to sharp their skills. I loved this app.,5
10/18/2016,Great...can't afford it though,4
10/18/2016,"First of all, Pluralsight's content is second-to-none, and worth watching more than most things on television. The app itself is close-to-great... speed controls, fast downloading of content for offline replay (if your subscription allows), and I usually use Miracast to send it to my television. which looks perfect. I use it at least once a week.",5
10/18/2016,Seems to have a problem playing downloaded content when there is a poor network connection. Since it seems to require it before playing the downloaded content. Really hit and miss if it works recently.,3
10/16/2016,Professional teachers. Very good App. Easy to use and navigate.,5
10/16/2016,"The main reason for me to use the mobile app is commuting, otherwise I can use the web site. But when I commute I need the navigation app in the foreground, and the Pluralsight app in the background playing just the audio of predownloaded courses. With the October 2016 update this totally works! Well done, guys!",5
10/15/2016,The new app is awesome,5
10/15/2016,A awesome tool every IT professional should have to keep up with the fast pace industry. Keep up the amazing work.,5
10/14/2016,"The app works well,however it does not keep the screen always on whilst watching videos.",4
10/14/2016,Very informitive,5
10/14/2016,"The app is great, but the most recent update causes the screen to timeout while the video is playing. It is unusable to me now as I cant watch a video without constantly touching the screeb",3
10/13/2016,You have to reactivate the device after each upgrade. And you need your corpo mail for that. As a result you don't have access to the course at the very unsuitable moment,2
10/13/2016,But still the massive amount of tutorials is so helpful,5
10/13/2016,Use it most of the time during commute.Good content ..Thanks,5
10/11/2016,Extremely vast and good coverage across topics.,5
10/11/2016,I downloaded few courses for offline reading yesterday. Today they have all gone missing. This is not the first time this is happening and feeling a bit frustrated. The only change I did was to move the downloaded clips to the alternate location suggested by the app.,2
10/10/2016,"Poor at best! Doesn't fully work in landscape mode, always starts back at the beginning of each module etc etc etc etc",1
10/10/2016,"If you want to skip to the next section and hit the next button, the app skips a random number of sections before playing one.",3
10/9/2016,"If I downloaded a course, it's most likely because I wanted to watch it offline...",1
10/8/2016,Please fix it.,2
10/7/2016,Been using this app for years and is a developer must in his tool box. For training or for reference.,5
10/6/2016,"The app plays content well for a while, then it just stops.  It doesn't &quot;pause&quot;; it stops while still indicating it's playing.  This happens in both portrait and landscape modes, streaming or with downloaded content, on the phone (Nexus 6P w/ 64 Gig RAM, Android 7.0) or casting to Chromecast.  When this happens, I can sometimes click on back &quot;||&quot; to return, but this is annoying and it doesn't return to the furthest point I watched, but to the beginning.  Sometimes the app isn't responsive at all.  Also,  when casting, after the phone turns the screen off and locks, while it does continue playing, if I unlock the phone, the app rewinds the lesson all the way to be beginning.   I love Pluralsight and its professional-level content.  But the app isn't quite working for me and, in fact, makes it very difficult to enjoy the content on my fairly current phone.",2
10/5/2016,I love Pluralslight. The courses are awesome and so is this app.,5
10/4/2016,Video restarts instead of playing the next one.  It doesn't stop after disconnecting headphones.  General design is not intuitive.  Only good thing is the download to the external SD card feature,2
10/4/2016,For me a subscription is useless without a good app for watching offline content. This app doesn t do that. *after the mayor update I renewed my subscribtion,5
10/4/2016,Really Nice..,5
10/4/2016,Chromecast is very convenient if your tv supports it.,4
10/2/2016,"I remember this app two years ago, it has changed so much for the better. It would be nice if you could add the Paths feature to it.",5
10/2/2016,"I often work nightshift security and try to continue learning things in my down time using my phone (Samsung galaxy S5). But this app causes more headaches then it helps solve. Logging into pluralsite with my digital tutors site name seems to cause enough trouble, but I have to go in unauthorise and re authorise my phone about once a week. This app gets 2 stars because I can still get to the lessons I'm paying for monthly, when it doesn't kick me out without warning.",2
10/1/2016,Awesome...📖,4
9/30/2016,It must be working like Netflix app.windows to Android app.continue from anywhere.Now works with  digitaltutors account it's good.please fix above,3
9/30/2016,"It's been 1.5 years since my previous comment, and I still can't actually use my pluralsight subscription on the move! So its absolutely not worth paying for the more expensive subscription.  The choppy video issues have been solved,but now I need to be permanently connected to the Internet in order to view previously downloaded 'offline' content. This means you can't actually use this app on an airplane / bus / train, etc. because the content will be hidden. Today my offline content was randomly deleted.",1
9/29/2016,I use it all the time for my studies. I like that we can download the videos. All in all a good app,5
9/28/2016,#NAME?,1
9/28/2016,Amazing collection of courses. Love the experience,5
9/27/2016,I recommend to anyone looking to upgrade theirs skills. I do wish however there was more participation by the instructors in the discussions tab.,4
9/26/2016,perfect,5
9/26/2016,It does what i want it to do,5
9/25/2016,Love it makes me fell better at my role in it,5
9/25/2016,Great ui and courses. Cheers,5
9/25/2016,Love the courses,5
9/24/2016,After application upgrade nothing works.,2
9/24/2016,It looses downloaded courses and after the last update it crashes after I switch to some other application(e.g. WhatsApp). The couses are good but without reliable application they are worthless.,2
9/22/2016,Only reason not 5 stars is issue with 4g. Cannot stream smoothly even with strong 4g signal.,4
9/22/2016,"Content for technical courses is very good. However, facing issues related to downloaded course related files after every update.Many of the downloaded course files get deleted or are not recognised and shown missing causing to repeat downloads.Please fix the same.

9/18/2016,"the player takes a very long time to remember last position. also, when playing, try to turn off the device screen, then turn on again. player will go crazy.    this makes the app hard to use if you need to pause and resume often",2

9/18/2016,Awesome work ...very helpful for developers like me!!,4
9/18/2016,Screen Cast option is not there,3
9/16/2016,I uninstalled this app several months ago due to annoying bugs. I'm happy to say they have all been resolved and this is an awesome app now!,5
9/16/2016,u Lerner the robotz,4
9/15/2016,Now I can hear the course while the app is in the background!,5
9/15/2016,Train time.  Watch on train multiple times per week.  I have yet to have issues.,5
9/14/2016,"The app is very good an gets frequent updates an improvements. A little buggy but looks to be getting better over time. They have fixed a few of my issues so they do take reviews seriously.  I just wish it wouldn't log you out of app every few weeks. Annoying. Just save the password forever. It's a long, complex password, an it's a pain to re-enter. Not sure why there login policy is so short but it would be nice not to have to save the password in a note pad on the phone.",4
9/14/2016,Functions on on WiFi but useless even on 4g. Constant freezings and dropouts.,2
9/13/2016,"I seem to have a problem making downloads to go into sd card. I have tried several times, no matter you have selected downloaded location to be sd card, it still downloads courses to internal memory. I even restarted phone; still it downloads to internal memory. Please fix this sooner. Cheers",4
9/13/2016,"Content is good and app sucks... Video disappears still audio plays, there is no way to go back to video except exit the app and open the app..then go to course and resume.",1
9/11/2016,"I'm sick of paying to download content to my device only for it to demand a logon when I have no data access! That's why I downloaded the content, knowing data access is unavailable! I'm paying money for content it won't let me see. Will be cancelling subscription.",1
9/11/2016,"After sorting the downloaded play back issues, 5 stars!",5
9/8/2016,The previous version had some serious issues but this new version has fixed them all and is reliable and responsive. Good job!!,5
9/7/2016,Excellente!!,5
9/7/2016,Very nice this apps. To learn to future tecnologics,5
9/7/2016,"I pause the application and turn the screen off. Then, when someone calls me, the app starts by itself and I have to listen to the speaker and the lection. It's uncomfortable. I have to refuse the call, turn off the app, and then call the person myself. I have a Xiaomi phone. MIUI7. Is it the same for others?",3
9/6/2016,The app for android sucks. Considering its a development training app and I pay 25 bucks a month I'd expect the app to be perfect. Navigation is all over the place,3

9/4/2016,No video zoom.,3
9/3/2016,"the interface is big button friendly but doesn't mature quick and easy work of during by certification paths - you can do it and is only slightly clumsy. I am disappointed in the inability to stream it over Chromecast. The platform is common, commonly used by a lot of us and would seem to me to be an obvious pairing. Streaming from this app has become reliable but the lack of extensibility leaves it unremarkable.",3
9/3/2016,"As said by PluralSight, I changed the storage location to external sd card in my profile, however it is not working properly. It's get downloaded but also get automatically deleted. Very horrible. I tried few times but everytime it is the same issue.",5

8/30/2016,Excellent app with excellent learning videos. Worth the money paid for license .,5
8/30/2016,"The content is good, my rating is purely for the android app.   Pros: the app is simple and the search function is good.  Cons: mean time to failure is too low i.e. It crashes often.",2
8/30/2016,Since the last update none of the courses play. Constant &quot;an error occurred&quot; messages.,1

8/16/2016,It got better.,4
8/16/2016,"I've been a fan of pluralsight for years. I enjoyed their app on iOS, but after switching to Android the app is extremely choppy in full screen mode - online and offline content. When not in full screen it runs fine. I get the impression that the custom ffmpeg codec they created is not designed for higher resolution devices (I'm using a Note 4). If they ever figure out the choppiness issue this will be a five star review.  Edit: It's been a year, about the upgrades they've made to the app are exception. The app is everything you'd expect from a company like Pluralsight and it's now exactly what I am looking for in a tutorial application.",5
8/16/2016,"This was a 5 stars app, the quality dropped with the shift from the orange to black. The support was great to send me the old app. Followed by the comment of pluralsight support, I updated and I am pleased with the new version with the offline sdcard. Thank you!",5

Old post:   I have 90+ GB that could be used for offline study but this app cannot be used this way. Pluralsight is competing with my VR content and email for internal storage.,4

8/14/2016,"Auto renews monthly billing even when you specifically turn it off. Not cool.  Although content is generally good when relevant, too expensive and far in between when not. UI is buggy and kinda crappy considering they are selling expert knowledge on the subject. Customer support is less than mediocre.",2

8/13/2016,"One must sign up for a trial period AND give up credit card info before being able to peruse the course offerings. If one does not proactively cancel the account auto debiting begins.

8/11/2016,"Latest version is now 5 star. you  can adjust playback speed, switch apps without restart and background playback works as well. I am glad that they've fixed it",5
8/11/2016,With new update my downloaded videos stop working only skipping to another other moving to sd card and back to default,1
8/11/2016,Good platform to learn,4
8/11/2016,I installed the new version. As mentioned in the update the old files will automatically saved to selected location. But when I go to offline videos it says files not found.,5
8/10/2016,Can`t download videos to sd card,5
8/10/2016,Good luck if you're a DT customer,5
8/5/2016,Highest quality possible!,5
8/5/2016,Really good videos,5
8/5/2016,Still supporting you :D,5
8/4/2016,"I like the fact I can finally view tutorials on-the-go. Well, in theory. Everytime I download tutorials and attempt to view them the app crashes. &quot;Unfortunately, Pluralsight has stopped.&quot; I have reported the issue before but no word back yet.",2
8/3/2016,Good,5
8/3/2016,"Constantly have to authorise the same device when viewing content on my mobile device, which is not easily remedied if your not near a desktop computer since the web site that loads up on your mobile device does not grant you access to authorise any device what so ever. I'm beginning to see understand why many pirate this stuff, the headache is dealt only to paying customers.",1
8/2/2016,offline video downloading doesn't resume on its own. the ui for download is not very user friendly. very confusing to use. Web application is far much better than the app.,2
8/1/2016,"I can log in with my Digital Tutors account! Now I see that there are other problems. Have to keep reauthorizing device to sign in with DT school account. There needs to be a browse function, not just search. Being able to jump to specific software or topic and then watch is crucial. Having general industry categories like IT or Creative isn't nearly enough. Definitely need to be able to see software icons attached to video descriptions. Video thumbnails are also needed.",2
7/29/2016,"Pluralsight has the best content for IT professionals.  I usually don't write reviews.  But Pluralsight deserves a shout out so I am giving them one.  Hola back, yo!",5
7/27/2016,Loves it,5
7/27/2016,"This is highly recommended for experienced people in software technologies, the videos are clearly explained with efficient tone. You can not see complete videos with out sub scription. My company provided me free subscription to this app ☺",5
7/27/2016,I tried to start several courses but the video won't start. When I leave the app I start hearing the video about 3 minutes later even though I am no longer inside the course when I return to the app. The app only shows new or popular courses so you can only search the other ones (no categories to browse through or similar) at least you can filter the results. Unfortunately with an individual account you cannot do courses offline. As the videos really do not work for me two stars only..,2
7/24/2016,The app has all features that make the site great and adds additional benefit of saved content for offline usage. Great job!,5
7/24/2016,The app feels like an MVP. The Web version is far more polished.,1
7/24/2016,Application is way better now. I can't install on my Andtoid TV. I can't even find it in google play. Would be nice if I don't have to connect my PC just to watch my cources.,4
7/24/2016,"Video frequently freezes, especially after switching to other apps and back (which you do a lot, if you want to check something in browser). And now it broke completely - while I can navigate in courses, video is not playing at all. Clearing cache was of no help.",1
7/23/2016,I love this service!,5
7/20/2016,It's missing important features: 1) ability to save offline videos to SD card; and 2) ability to play downloaded clips without requiring an internet connection. I can't play offline clips here because it keeps looking for an internet connection in order to display the table of contents. This defeats the purpose of offline clips. Please fix these 2 bugs.,1
7/20/2016,"Seems flaky, does not allow storage of content other than to internal storage.",2
7/19/2016,Needs the ability to sync course progress when after watching downloaded courses.,3
7/19/2016,Update: New version is amazing!,4
7/18/2016,App crashes every now and then on my android devices. Please fix it ASAP. Any update on my complaint??,1
7/16/2016,"App runs smoothly, no problems were found. In the future I would like to see possibility of downloading only certain videos not whole course. Before going to 'Internet dead zone' I could download 4-5 videos and then enjoy them. Or at least downloading should not consider already viewed videos (but sometimes you would like to, so the first feature seems better).",5
7/15/2016,Works well. Nothing to complain about.,5
7/15/2016,I am completely delighted with the standards of learning and video quality.,4
7/14/2016,"Im a paying subscriber.  I opened the app with Wi-Fi off and so it told me it was offline. so I turned on Wi-Fi but the app still thinks there is no internet, despite the fact that I can get to the internet I'm surfing, this message is being dictated into Google voice over the internet butt the plural sight app still thinks there is no Internet it's like it's stuck.  Bottom line when you want to access your courses offline this app is still buggy, and even when you get it back online the issues persist.  Raise the priority on making Android work please!!",2
7/14/2016,Super good,5
7/14/2016,"My team has part of its performance rating tied to a requirement for technical and business growth.

7/13/2016,"A good app now, after the problems it had when it was first released. I can start to watch videos on the go again.",4
7/13/2016,I liked the orientation of UI nd the app is smooth. Thanks to Developers for taking a time to thank me...,5
7/13/2016,Just tried this app again and finally the sound issues which plagued previous versions have been fixed. Thank you!,4
7/13/2016,Great app for learning and awesome content.,5
7/12/2016,Love the fact I can download training and watch it while traveling,5
7/11/2016,Great work guys,5
7/11/2016,Can't login in the app with my digital tutors account,5
7/10/2016,"Everything fine, login with digital tutors works perfect. Thanks for fixing that!",5
7/9/2016,Go for it..just go for it,5
7/9/2016,"Good apps,  for education learning",5
7/9/2016,"Unlike any other phone media player I know, this one doesn't pause when you receive and then take a call. This means you hear the callers voice on top of the video audio until you find your way back from the call screen to the app to get to pause it.",2
7/8/2016,Digital Tutors Subscribers Accounts Not Synced,5
7/8/2016,"Please fix digital-tutors login support. [FIX] 8. July, Love it!",5
7/8/2016,When are you guys going to integrate digital-tutors authentication into your app? This single obstacle prevents me from giving you a 5. I simply cannot use the app.,5
7/7/2016,"The app has a good UI and is a must hv on android. However, I'm facing a major problem as there is no option to login to the app using my Digital Tutors login. Hence I'm unable to use the mobile app and have to use a browser instead. Kindly provide an option to login using the Digital Tutors account.",5
7/7/2016,"It is too often causing my phone ro freeze, so I have to restart it. Really annoying, since they have really good materials, which are worth to watch!",2

7/5/2016,We're on the right track!!!!! :),5
7/5/2016,Video quality is great and tools are easy to get to on the application.,5
7/4/2016,"Everything works fine. Very very needed feature, I am not able to move my offline(downloaded) courses to my SD card. Usually phone devices have very less memory.",4
7/4/2016,Very good app,5
7/3/2016,"Yes, you read that right. I gave it one star, while the app is great and plays even when screen is off (which I like), the app downloads content to internal memory only, and you can't move the app to external storage either. Thereby making the app pointless for listening or watching content on the public transport commute.",1
7/3/2016,Watched about 30 mins of a course... Went back to it and had to manually find my way back. Often plays in the background when I've closed the app to. Not great. Still love the course contents though,3
7/3/2016,it needs to be on par with PC version,1
7/2/2016,"Great source knowledge, but have some issue with load video pleas fix it",5
7/1/2016,I started with WCF End to End course. Very professionally presented. And am sure all others will be awesome too.,5
7/1/2016,Good one.................,5
6/30/2016,"Hi, how can i login with my digitaltutors subscription??? I can't login",1
6/30/2016,All the offline modules are erased once you apply any update.,5
6/29/2016,It's a nice app when it works,2
6/29/2016,I have been using this for less than a day and it's really good. No performance issues yet and that's nice.,5
6/28/2016,Very helpful excellent,5
6/28/2016,Looks like this could be an awesome alternative to viewing content via a Web browser on tablet/phone. But has issues making this unusable. Please fix.,2
6/28/2016,Super application,5
6/27/2016,Continues playing when receiving a phone call. Google music starts playing too. Background playback broken.,2
6/25/2016,Android version has issues. Doesn't run smoothly unless you download each clip. Other streaming apps have no problem!,1
6/24/2016,But have a problems sometimes when I try to get offline course.,4
6/23/2016,Changing hor/vert layout causes lots off buffering. So does losing connection temporarily. Gives me the feeling it doesnt buffer at all.,2
6/23/2016,Thanks,5
6/22/2016,So the world was supposed to be great when PS took over Digital Tutors..all these many months later and you still can't access DT on an Android device....,1
6/19/2016,content are great.  Only downside is vey high price 499$ per year is too much.  Till last year for india it was 249.5 but now its 499,5
6/18/2016,Cannot store videos on SD card. Without that the app is useless.,1
6/18/2016,Very nice application where find my all relevant tutorial nugget's that helped me alot.,5
6/17/2016,"UPDATE 6/17/2016:  Speed control has been added in and it actually works great this time.  I finally can give this App 5 stars as I have test several new and very old training and they all work great.  THANKYOU for fixing the bugs!  I can now ditch using the clunky web interface.  Note that the web interface works great on a laptop, but on my Nexus table it is a bit clunky which has to do with the tablet not your web interface.",5
6/17/2016,Watching online works ok. Downloading for offline stalls at 50% of 1 video and never completes. Can't set speed faster than x2.,3
6/16/2016,"Just a black screen, long pause caching maybe 30 seconds Doesn't run right on samsung note 4.  Does load eventually. Fortunately,  the long wait unnerving. Website version is awesome,  used this last year as a student rate,  don't remember being as bad. Is there any way to download previous apps? Still on lollipop,  maybe better on marshmallow.",2
6/16/2016,"The content is great, really helps fill in the gaps of what I don't know. The video playback is such a pain, all I see 60% of the time is video playback error, regardless if it's downloaded our not. Whether I'm on wifi or not. If it played more consistently I'd have no issue with it.",3
6/16/2016,This has happened second time. Downloaded video were deleted after the update. Request you to investigate the issue.,2
6/15/2016,It would be better if the screen rotate automatically to horizontal view even the &quot;rotate off&quot; feature is enabled. Thanks team for the great work.,5
6/15/2016,"The app is great, and ever improving and the content is overall good!",5
6/15/2016,Great!,5
6/15/2016,Excellent Everything!!! Fantastic company,5
6/15/2016,Please add in speed control without it this app is near worthless to me.,3
6/15/2016,Features that probably should have been available from day one are now there. App is now so much better (as is the website) which makes a subscription much better value.,4
6/14/2016,"Iam using android 4.1 device and unable to view videos,i can only hear the sound.that is not good for my productivity as i relay on pluralsight for ready refrence.please help as i love using plurasight and beig using it for 1year",1
6/12/2016,Current version seems to crash and lock up quite a bit on my android LG phone. Previous versions were more robust.,3
6/12/2016,"No SD card support means although the downloaded clips do play, offline even, i had no space for a complete course and i should think the majority don't have a phone with 8GB or more of internal memory available. Add external memory support and the app will get 5 *s  from me....maybe....it also needs a way to refresh without logging out and in again.",3
6/12/2016,Rating would be much higher if I could store downloaded courses to sd.  Makes it unusable for me.,1
6/11/2016,With last update. The downloaded courses disappeared but still takes space in my memory card and I can't even delete them.,2
6/10/2016,"Great app,  absolutely fantastic!  A must have for professionals.",5
6/10/2016,It is good app but can not watch video in full screen. And issue is fixed in next update . Thanks Team,4
6/9/2016,For fixing the lock bug,4
6/8/2016,When I am downloading the training videos it's getting stored in the device memory. Is it possible to store it in the SD card instead of device memory.,4
6/8/2016,Use it everyday! Just works and offers two main features I care about - offline viewing and video speedup.,5
6/8/2016,"No menu while playing. To bring up basic play options the buttons get clicked accidently , most often changing the chapter accidently. No playback speed. No streaming quality  options. No toggle option for portrait.  Update (05/05/2016) --&gt; the latest upgrade is better. -8 sec, variable speed are useful. Still missing a dedicated orientation button or full screen option. Update 6/8/2016 perfect. Full screen mode available now. Giving 5 stars now.",5
6/8/2016,Huge improvements. Love it,5
6/7/2016,Awesome again.,5
6/7/2016,I need to keep learning new IT products as part of my job. Pluralsight makes this easy more cost effective than similar products,5
6/7/2016,There should be a way to specify a playback orientation regardless of the device setting,4
6/3/2016,Bad,1
6/2/2016,I can log in fine through the browser but the app won't let me log in because my account is through digital tutors. Please help,2
6/1/2016,For some odd reason when i subscribed to pluralsight it made me a digitaltutor account so now I cant even login to use the app and its confusing rn between the 2 sites.,1
6/1/2016,I want to know where are the offline videos stores in Android system,4
6/1/2016,"I love the content, but I hate the app. The video player is extremely buggy. The entire app will freeze in the middle of a video and then not save the place of the video when I get back into it. I see a setting to use VLC player but I can't get that to work either.. Fix the video player and it will get 5 stars.",2
5/31/2016,Kindly fix not to disappear downloaded videos after updating the app,4
5/30/2016,It's very hard to download videos and work out what you've watched.,3
5/30/2016,Really cool app,4
5/30/2016,It needs variable playback speed when chromecasting. 1x is just too slow for some courses,4
5/28/2016,Can't find the option to change the playback speed. Without it I'm wasting way too much time since a lot of taking is too slow.,3
5/27/2016,"This is the only app that currently hard crashes my phone. Often stops playing for no reason and when I resume, it goes back to the beginning of the module.",2
5/27/2016,There is no option to login with my company account,5
5/26/2016,The forgot password Link/button isn't working. How should I reset the password?,1
5/25/2016,I had to reboot to regain control.,1
5/25/2016,I'm paying $49 per month for a service that doesn't let me even log into the app. Kind of a joke.,1
5/25/2016,Fails to start videos,2
5/25/2016,"Hooray! It works on tablets now, and performance is much better.",4
5/23/2016,"Update For May 2016. Finally! It's been a painful road during development, but the application finally seems to do its functions and I haven't observed any current bugs.  The features it has are nice, offline works the way it's supposed to.  Thank you for the speed control, which works well by the way.  This app went from a zero star a 3 months to a year ago to a 5 star now.  This is a nice interface to using pluralsight material that synchronizes with other platforms usage of pluralsight and allows offline usage for pro subscribers.  Back in Apr 2016.  Getting better, can now at least delete videos and actually watch offline.  There are occasional crashes and deletions of downloaded videos which is very poor user experience. Synchronizing of playlists is in and working. Still missing the much desired variable speed playback. And the offline to online synchronizing is till hit or miss as to whether or not it updates my user history. Get rid of the crashes, download deletions by mistake, and add speed control and you've got a 5 star.",5
5/22/2016,I have a very fast Nexus 6p but the app keeps crashing and even while switching between the portrait and landscape mode it stops working and terminates the videos.,1
5/22/2016,Nice app 😋,5
5/22/2016,"Can't set the download location for offline viewing. My internal storage is limited, but the SD card is almost empty. Can't access my bookmarks.",3
5/22/2016,App has improved immeasurably over the previous version. Great.,5
5/22/2016,Pluralsight have listened to feedback and made changes to the app. Great work.,4
5/21/2016,Doesn't pause when receiving a call. Constantly gives me to re login when between lessons of a course.,3
5/20/2016,This app has come along way since the new design. Definitely a solid app. One thing that is becoming a necessity rather than luxury is the need to download videos to sd storage. I (along with many others) rely on offline storage to view courses and there's just not enough internal space to accommodate. I would greatly appreciate if this feature was on the way.,4
5/20/2016,"Nice application and the player works as well as the web player. The only issue is that when I play courses on my phone, the status does not get synced to the web version which makes it difficult to switch from the Phone to the Web interface. Syncing from the Web to the app, however, works perfectly.",4
5/20/2016,"It is far more better than the desktop windows app. This does contains the whole course with table of contents,  so you do not loose track,  whereas the desktop app just put all the videos and you would have to look for the videos for a particular course.",4
5/19/2016,It used to be terrible but it's getting better. Thanks for Chromecast support 😃,4
5/19/2016,Esay to use,5
5/18/2016,Great for offline viewing,4
5/17/2016,Missing speed control,5
5/17/2016,It would be great if Digital Tutors accounts could be supported since it's now a part of PluralSight. This app is useless to me.,2
5/17/2016,"When it works this is great, sadly it's very unreliable.  Frequently has assorted problems.  At the moment it keeps giving me errors whenever starting a section of a course.  Also clicking play while it's sitting there with a black screen skips to (and also fails to load usually)  the next sections.  Very frustrating.",2
5/17/2016,Definitely lots of improvements,5
5/17/2016,Great to see all the transformation to now...  GOOD experience.,5
5/16/2016,"I stopped really using the app due not displaying the list of modules in landscape mode; having you turn the the tablet,  find the course or particular module and then turn it back to landscape for viewing. Also saw recently that we can now download courses which I find ideal.  Now I don't necessarily have to be at a cafe. The service is great and my job pays for it.  Thank you.",5
5/16/2016,My log in does not work. I triple check it on the website.,2
5/13/2016,Been doing a lot of training. Great quality video and sound. App works fine.  The best part of this thus far is it just works.... easy to find training i need. Quick starting. Seamless ability to download to watch while commuting. Love this app so far! Thx,5
5/13/2016,"For an app which primarily is for downloading and watching videos, for it not to be able to put those on the external SD card is ridiculous (I almost ran outta space with one tutorial). Good app other than that.",2
5/13/2016,Greatest Resource Around,5
5/12/2016,"From bad to awesome. It didn't work at all for me a few months back, retried it now and it fells really, really solid. Nice looking with plenty of features. Happy panda is happy! Removing 1 star and giving 5. Keep up the great work and thanks, I appreciate it!",5
5/10/2016,"Using the tube I'd like to have 5-15min of the video cashed so I can use it through the stations! I can not believ3 that my videos are not being cashed upfront and the streaming goes only when stable connection. Your small brain managers should understand they are loosing tens of thousands of developers around the world using the tube! Have you managers ever asked why your score on mobile is so low? No wonder why you loose big shares of the market, you are just out of date what your markets are.",1
5/9/2016,Now supports variable playback speed! :-),5
5/9/2016,Best thing a new developer could ever do for their self,5
5/8/2016,"The variable speed is great, but the best feature (in my opinion) was being able to shut the screen off and keep listening.",4
5/7/2016,I really love pluralsight videos but the last update screwed up my video playing experience. Sometimes play button is unresponsive and as a workaround I have to press next and previous button to play. This is really annoying. Please fix!!,3
5/7/2016,"If you ask me, your new website redesign as well as this completely reimagined application are really a huge step forward, great UX, well done! Update: Rated 5 stars, finally we can adjust the playback speed! Thanks for listening to your users.",5
5/6/2016,Does not support accounts through digital tutors,1
5/6/2016,Great stable app all the important features are.,5
5/5/2016,Downloaded content does not play continually.. I cannot pause and play.,2
5/5/2016,The Digital Tutors password doesn't work.,1
5/5/2016,"Update 05/05: Oh.. you guys really did listen to the feedback! I am delighted.. Thank you for your kind attention. I do like the new experimental fast playback option. :) One more feature suggestion, there should be a fixed orientation selection option, instead of the phone waiting to reload the content every time  the orientation accidentally changes a bit.. even a rotation lock is fine!.. The KahnAcademy app does this really well.. along with the 10s + and - thing that they have, instead of just the 8s - you guys have here!  old comment: Come in guys.. Step it up!.. Consider doing a course on mobile to really Test your changes.. There is a whole lotta enhancements you can put to your video playback..Like the Play at a faster rate option, custom orientation rotate button (instead of automatic, which reloads the page everytime) Maybe give a video zoom functionality where the user can choose a part of the screen to zoom into (technically a little more involved, but very doable) .. the course download and playback functionality is also broke as hell.. I appreciate the attitude to make new ui changes but am very displeased with all the new unfurnished changes!",3
5/5/2016,The latest update really fulfilled my expectations. Great app. Play speed is back. Will recommend in heart beat.,5
5/5/2016,"Video speed setting, finally!",5
5/5/2016,This latest update is superb! With the return of variable speed playback I am a very happy customer once again.,5
5/5/2016,New version awesome. So happy the playback speed is back. It really put me off my study listening at standard speeds... now I can fly again! Thanks development and Pluralsight you saved my career and my sanity. Best app in my catalogue. Highly recommended.,5
5/5/2016,Please provide control over the speach speed.,5
5/5/2016,Variable speed playback makes this app an order of magnitude better.,4
5/5/2016,Superb content,5
5/4/2016,"Used to work fine, now no video. It only has audio. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  EDIT disabling variable speed playback fixed the issue",4
5/4/2016,OK app is way better with variable speed but damn! It still crashes after the 1st launch please help 😢,2
5/4/2016,"As others have mentioned, removing the variable playback speed significantly reduces the value of this app. It's pretty, but as a developer, I value function over style for my tools. Please bring it back ASAP!",5
5/4/2016,"Pluralsight is awesome. But this app wasn't. Anyway, it's catching up and getting better.",3
5/3/2016,"Very nice app, all features work correctly including offline videos and variable speed playback.",5
5/3/2016,The new variable playback speed is great!,5
5/3/2016,App crash issues are now resolved (v 2.4.1). Happy to report that online and offline videos are both working as expected. Thanks.,4
5/3/2016,"As of May 3rd, 2016 on my Galaxy S6 Edge, videos now play flawlessly when transitioning from one lecture to the next. Thanks for listening to the reviews and the prompt fixes, it works great now. I liken Pluralsight to The Matrix. I can just quickly download a skill into my brain (watching a course) and then bam, I'm good to go. Many thanks Pluralsight! ;)",5
5/3/2016,Devs fixed the crashes I was getting so it plays content now. Good work guys!,5
5/3/2016,But you're limited by storage. Wish we could save training to SD card so I could load up for a long disconnected trip. Other than that it's pretty cool.,3
5/2/2016,Finally variable playback speed,5
5/2/2016,Love it,5
5/2/2016,It does what it's supposed to,4

4/28/2016,"I'm trying to watch the Modern C++ Libraries course, but the player skips back to the previous module after each clip! Annoying!",2
4/28/2016,Videos start from first after pause or screen rotation. It irritates me.,3
4/26/2016,I liked the app but feel like it's lacking one key feature: playback speed adjustment setting. This is a must have feature for any learning service that relies on video/audio playback.,3
4/25/2016,They have a large selection of great content to learn from.,5
4/25/2016,Cannot access my digital tutors account. Please fix.,2
4/24/2016,Great quality videos. Would be nice if there were more options like where to save videos etc.,4

4/23/2016,is helping to take my career to the next level.... Use it on the drive home.,5
4/22/2016,Gets better with every release,4
4/21/2016,"The app looks nice and easy to navigate around. I can quickly find what I'm looking for so far. One apparent minor issue is the fact that there's no button to change the orientation of the video (or I just can't find it). I have to turn on my device orientation to get the orientation that I want which is annoying because my accelerometer can behave funnily sometimes. For me, it doesn't make sense to retain portrait orientation during video playback with all the wasted space above and below the video.",4
4/19/2016,Works fine for me.,5
4/19/2016,"Off-line experience is poor, which is the only reason you would install the app. It downloads content using your mobile data when the WiFi only option is switched on. Course download is unreliable and skips modules. Occasionally wipes entire downloaded courses.",2
4/18/2016,"The UI can be a little jaring at times, however massive improvement over the last version and has some excellent content.",4
4/18/2016,Does not recognize digital tutors login information :(,1
4/16/2016,No sign up button.,1
4/16/2016,Is amazing awesome fab and last not least love this site.,5
4/15/2016,"It works fine, doesn't crash. The only problem is that I can't play it at 2x speed. To me that's the same thing as not being able to load the video, because I will not watch these at 1x, so it's basically useless to me.  If you have issue with bandwidth and processing 2x, at least allow it for only downloaded courses and meet us half way.  Then you'll get a lot more 5 stars.",1
4/14/2016,"On my 2nd gen Nexus 7, I get kicked out at the end of every video segment. I reopen the app and try to continue and the same thing happens with the next video segment.",1
4/14/2016,Whenevr I click any course to resume then it shows message as unexpected error,1
4/14/2016,"Love the service and application in general, but am rather disappointed there is no playback speed option in the android version. I watch at 1.8x speed and I'd rather not take my iPad to work each day just to watch normally. Please add this feature and I will update my review to 5*. Many thanks!",4
4/13/2016,Background author voice get breaks while playing. Taking too much time to load and play video though the network bandwidth is high and fast.,3
4/13/2016,It doesn't plays the video and reports some unexpected error occurred even after updating the app,2
4/13/2016,"Why can't your app save credentials? It's disgusting to enter them each time you open the app. I normally don't use it each day but whenever i do, i always have to sign in. It's not a bank application where such security features are required but don't find the use case in your app.",3
4/13/2016,Having used the previous version of this app extensively and putting up with the buggy playback I was looking forward to trying out the new version. How disappointing that variable speed playback is missing rendering it effectively useless for me.  Update: Fixed now - rating adjusted accordingly.,4
4/12/2016,This is a core feature I've been waiting a ridiculous amount of time for it to be reintroduced,1
4/12/2016,"Couldn't log in so app deleted, disappointing.",1
4/12/2016,"After the update, the app is an excellent companion for learning new things in programming",4
4/11/2016,"There are a lot of great courses, but the app is not functional. Half the time videos won't even play before the app crashes, other times I can watch just part of a video before it becomes unresponsive and closes. As a paying customer I expect more from their app, which was a selling point for me as I my phone for tutorials most of the time. Fix the problem and my rating would be at least 4 stars.",1
4/10/2016,Previous version allowed  download but later version  not allowing...,2

4/4/2016,Come on guys you need feature parity with ios,2
4/2/2016,The reintroduction of variable speed makes this a must have app.  Great interface and an ever growing resource if invaluable tutorials.,4
4/1/2016,Is it not implemented yet? Really miss this feature,3
3/30/2016,Much better than it was...,4
3/29/2016,Videos immediately error out when played landscape or portrait...downloaded or streamed.  Uninstalling the app doesn't help eirher.  Ehh...,1
3/29/2016,"So there I was.. Just about to get into some awesome responsive design tutorials with Brian Treese and the video crashed, downloaded everything and it crashed in the same place. Opened on the web and it was fine, so my rating reflects the app alone, not the quality of pluralsights content as it seems to be great. Before I joined pluralsight I already read playback issues so it is an ongoing issue. Please fix and I'll update my rating.",3
3/27/2016,"1) App does not remember login information. 2) Widgets do not have controls for advancing to the next video in a module or going back to the previous one. 3) No video seek or playback speed controls any where. 4) Bookmarks and Playlists cannot be re-ordered and are not auto-ordered alphabetically. 5) Content discovery by category, tool, certification or learning path is not available. 6) Playback does not auto-advance to the next video in a module if not on course page.",1
3/26/2016,Great App,5
3/26/2016,Turning screen orientation corrupts the playing video. Will start again during rotation. Seeking a video??? An issue to resolve.,3
3/26/2016,I love plural sight. They have the best courses.,5
3/25/2016,Suprb app for learners,5
3/23/2016,I'm a big fan of pluralsight. My professional carrier improved a lot with their tutorials. Love you Pluralsight,5
3/21/2016,"Some improvements are needed:  1. Ability to change speed of play like in web version. 2. Changing from portrait to landscape pauses videos and force them to reload. This  can be frustrating at times 3. When I receive a phone call while watching a video course and accept the call, phone app comes to foreground but i still can hear video playing in background. This is  annoying because i need to put person on hold, change back to pluralsight app, pause the video and then resume my phone call.",3
3/21/2016,Nice presentation,5
3/20/2016,Pluralsight is awesome :),5
3/19/2016,There is no velocity control anymore. UPDATE: There is one on Beta app and is very stable!,4

3/15/2016,Can't view learning path ( Pluralsight Creative ),3
3/15/2016,Pluralsight is one of the best online sources for e-learning. The application is now usable and has improved a lot. Keep the good work.,4
3/14/2016,Good,4

3/14/2016,"Can't log on. Have digital tutor account. Will change rating once, I'm able to log on.",1
3/13/2016,"I love Pluralsight,but this app bites. There no speed control, so you can't speed up slow videos. Worst of all, the scroll function only works if you manage to find that magic spot where it will respond, otherwise it just appears and hides when you try to operate it. Very frustrating",2
3/13/2016,"I am newly subscribed at digital tutors, I was wishing to watch tuts through this mobile app but I ended up failing to sign in :-(",3
3/13/2016,"This was a killer feature, and the main reason I was using this app.",3
3/12/2016,I use strong alphanumeric password & its pain to type it. Why do you need to log me out?,2
3/12/2016,"Great content, app works but is still a little clunky. The navigation controls while improved over the previous version, are still choppy, and the slider control can still be tricky to operate. The &quot;disable back button&quot; feature seems pointless, as it will still exit your video if accidentally tapped. Would prefer to disable back/app-switch during playback (still preserving the close button, which is often tactile and less sensitive on tablets). The buttons should still work when not watching a video.",3
3/11/2016,Much improvement over the old app,5
3/10/2016,Well developed app. Five stars once variable speed controls are included.,4
3/9/2016,"Great app, must admit missing the speed up feature. Please bring it back.",4
3/9/2016,"App works well, however I would very much enjoy a Chromecast feature to more easily watch these videos on a larger screen",5
3/9/2016,Great contents.,4
3/5/2016,"Fantastic content. But: Please don't restart the video if I rotate my device, or switch apps.",4
3/5/2016,Nice flexibly to study in public transportation,5
3/4/2016,It only works in new devices.,1
3/3/2016,I'm not authorized? How come it is like this that Im not authorized to use the app? Please fix this,2
3/2/2016,"Pluralsight content is superb. Constantly refreshed, it is one of the best ways to get familiar with a new technology, or brush up on things one thought to master. The iOS app is OK, but the Android app is not up to par. The Kindle app no longer works after my Kindle was upgraded to Fire OS 5.1.1.",2
3/2/2016,I can't log on with my digital tutors account and the web version of this is nearly unusable.  Please fix.,1
3/1/2016,The app crashes very frequently,2
2/28/2016,Be good to have the speed control function.  Also configurable video quality would be helpful to enable lower data usage.,4
2/28/2016,Great app but hangs some times even with good band width internet.,4
2/28/2016,Can't sign in using my digital tutors acount,3
2/26/2016,It pains me to listen to super slow course. Speed control should be here by now. We have waited long enough. When are you going to do something about it?,3
2/25/2016,"The website is elegant and functional, this app is not.",2
2/24/2016,"I subscribed to Pluralsight solely on the basis that courseware was available for consumption offline. Initially this capability worked, however a recent update to the app now requires an ONLINE login to consume downloaded content. My latest opportunity to skill up with Pluralsight on a 14 hour flight was thwarted by such an obvious oversight by Pluralsight developers. Unfortunately unless the offline consumption issue is addressed I will not be continuing with my subscription.",1
2/24/2016,Recent updates made it very good,4
2/23/2016,Would be nice to be able to browse the catalog.,3
2/21/2016,My video blocks while the sound keeps playing.,3
2/20/2016,crashes constantly. come on guys ...,1
2/16/2016,"The application is good, but courses played at very slow rate, I need to speed them up, which is a feature in the site, but missing in the app.",3
2/16/2016,"By far the worst subscription product I've ever experienced. The player is so bad, scavenging around a to p2p site will be much more worth your time. Stops if your device flips from portrait to landscape orientation or lose Internet connection even for DOWNLOADED clips. It will sit and spin for mins and then start again from the beginning. I get 4min on a 30 min journey! My radio app plays throughout this journey! Coming from experts, this is shameful...you can't develop your own app and make it work",1
2/16/2016,Pluralsight as an online resource is great. No questions. But android app spoils everything. Sure it is much more easier to watch courses with your tab. But all the problems mentioned by other users are real and annoying.  - When you shut the screen in general you need to start watching video from the beginning. - Scroll bar is too tiny. I have never experienced anything which is so hard to scroll. - Your progress on a tablet does not synchronize with the site. Perhaps I miss something but there is not synch button and app does not do it automatically. This app is a total disaster now. I hope it will be updated soon.,3
2/15/2016,"I can't login with my ID. Please, fix it.",1
2/15/2016,"Ironically, this app teaches how to do programming as well as best practices to do it but the app itself is poorly developed. Downloaded several modules hoping to play it offline but it just force closed. Reinstalled again giving it another chance but the player is performing poorly especially when rotating screen playing an already downloaded clip! I disconnected from the net to see if it would play offline but nope! Must go online to play an already downloaded clip.",1
2/13/2016,Can't login,1
2/13/2016,I would recommend to provide an functionality that once user selects an video quality or any selected attributes of the video then it should be applied to the upcoming videos automatically. For each and every video we need to select video quality. Hope you will be up with this feature asap,4
2/12/2016,Stops playing when switching apps.  Skips backward when turning the screen on. Often starts the section over.,2
2/10/2016,This has been said before... But probably if a lot of people are saying it somebody will make the improvement. Video takes a long time to reload when orientation changes and some option to change the speed is needed.,3
2/10/2016,Missing landscape mode for video on Lenovo A6000,4
2/6/2016,Digital tutors customer and can't even log in. Why even have an app!? Terrible.,1
2/6/2016,"Hi developers, kudos to this awesome application. But when I download some offline videos it saves in my phone memory and not in SD card. So next release could you please add SD card save option",4
2/5/2016,Company login is not working,1
2/4/2016,"Still no speed control?  This should have never been released.  Speed control was not an optional feature for most of us.  I haven't used the app in months, considering cancelling my subscription unless it's coming soon.",1
2/3/2016,Include this feature and get 5 stars.,3
2/3/2016,Missing playback speed option,2
2/2/2016,It won't take my login info.,1
2/1/2016,No option to change playback speed. This option was so important! The earlier version of pluralsight was much better.,1
2/1/2016,It would be nice to see a &quot;lock screen orientation&quot; feature while the video is playing. Currently the video reloads every time my phone turns or shakes. Makes it hard to get training in during the morning commute.,3
1/31/2016,"Video speed control required,Video starts from first when screen is rotated,better browsing feature should get included than searching for topic",3
1/31/2016,"Decent but would expect more. Features are missing, I check out the 'new' category and there are things from years ago mingled in the list. Would expect more especially since I bought a subscription.",1
1/29/2016,Makes the app quite unusable for most of the content that I am interested in.,2
1/28/2016,I really wish I could get the old app back. It had playback speed options and this new one does not. That is a great feature to me. I wish I could choose to store the downloaded modules on my sd card since I have plenty of room there but I'm limited on the phone storage with other apps I have.,1
1/28/2016,And no login recognised for digital tutors paying customers. Is that fair or professional or acceptable? People still waiting 2.5 years for ios backpack. Improve this.,1
1/27/2016,"Most are now driving me to sleep,  bring back the speed play option",4
1/25/2016,No variable speed. IPhone users have this.,1
1/25/2016,"Another update, and I have to download ALL of the offline content again! :-(",1
1/25/2016,Most of the bugs and limitations related to online support fixed. Still missing some features from the old app (e.g.speed control),4
1/24/2016,Can't logon to the App. My login works perfectly on the internet but can't login into the App. Keep getting a 403 error,1
1/24/2016,I would like to move to the SD card. It restarts the lesson when orientation changes.,4
1/23/2016,Easy to use and friendly UI. I enjoy the ability to sync videos for offline use. The only downside is that I can't have the app sync it to my sdcard.,4
1/21/2016,"Although this new app looks flashy, it lacks some basic features. To me this is unable without the variable speed control. I never watch a course at 1x speed. My usage has pretty much come to a halt without this feature. I am thinking of canceling the subscription and restarting when they have the feature available.",1
1/20/2016,My login credentials are not working on the mobile app. This is bad for a paid service ...,2
1/20/2016,"Most features you expect are available: offline play, decent download management (not necessarily the most intuitive but it's there and it works), playlists and bookmarked content syncs correctly, chromecast is supported well. My only remaining gripe is the lack of playback speed adjustment, which can make all the difference on some of the longer videos.",4
1/19/2016,"If the screen orientation changes while watching a video, I have to hit Play, then hit Pause, then hit Play again in order to get the video to start back up. A lot of the time, the video starts over from the beginning. Other than that, great app!",4
1/17/2016,"Login credentials are correct but do not work on the app, i  just keep getting &quot;login/password incorrect&quot; error, same credentials works fine on when using pluralsight on laptop. Would be nice to see this fixed and view content on phone. Please fix, Thank you.",2
1/17/2016,"The new app is a massive improvement.  The content is excellent, and the core functionality works well.  The video and audio play smoothly and without interruption and the recent addition of Chromecast support is a welcomed addition.  The app still lacks a few of the features I'd expect to see given the price of the subscription (i.e. assessments).  I'm looking forward to future iterations.",5
1/16/2016,No way to remove downloaded courses!,4
1/15/2016,"I got this app by searching digital tutors, but my surprise is that doesnt work with the account of DT...",1

1/12/2016,"When casting to Chromecast, I've had issues when attempting to rewind or fast forward. Also, navigation could be improved.",4
1/11/2016,Woohoo. Videos are in landscape now.  Thanks guys,5
1/11/2016,PluralSight worths every cent and this android app has improved a lot. I've alao just seen that it finally casts to chromecast which is very useful for me.,5
1/10/2016,"It's not possible to select a specific video, and courses always start all over again.",1
1/9/2016,I love the sessions but please stop forcing us to use a product that is just not done. Not even close to done. We dont pay to be your testers and the offline app is (was) a big selling point for me.,1
1/8/2016,When i try to rewind it just spins,3
1/7/2016,After last update progress bar is no longer usable as it's hidden under android action bar. Having no ability to navigate within a clip is a disaster,1
1/7/2016,Amazing app. Can wqtch even when i have no internet connection by downloading them. Simply put great work,5
1/6/2016,I can't just browse the course catalog anymore via the app.,3
1/6/2016,"I have access to Pluralsite through my college group portal on Digital Tutors, but I can't sign in through the app.",1
1/6/2016,"Beautiful looking app, but the user experience has a long way to go. Simply searching, looking at a course and going back to your search will bring endless frustration. Come on guys, you're meant to be an authority on this stuff.",3
1/6/2016,"You removed some of the most needed feaures...  Varable speed playback and a true offline mode.  Please give those features back or make the old app avalable. Video will not even maximize (this fixed in update, +1 star).",2

1/4/2016,Great app alongside the website.   Worth subscribing too.,5
1/4/2016,"Same details from Digital Tutors but nope, won't allow me to log in. Changed my password twice but still. So useless. And what's with raising the subscription from 65CAD to 70CAD without telling me? No email or nothing. Ain't this some s**t?",1

1/1/2016,No option to choose not to use cellular data,1
1/1/2016,"Playback control are still not consistent,  and biggest setback is that all new videos are recorded aspect ratio of 16:9.

12/29/2015,I don't need to buffer the whole video I want to watch in order to auto play a video.  When you break up videos up into &lt;5min segments this can get quite annoying.  You app makes me want to star in my own Serbian film.,1
12/29/2015,"Low in features, poor search, out of sync with navigation and design ideology of the website.",3
12/29/2015,"Navigation is very buggy. The touch screen is often not working. It can be difficult to navigate through the clips, screen rotation doesn't work and you can't store the courses on your SD card. The last upgrade also deleted all my saved courses. However it still just about works and you can get by and watch courses while online and offline so it still does what I need it to do. It seems whoever created the app probably needs to take some of the pluralsight courses as well.",3
12/28/2015,This app only works 70% of the time on my samsung tablet,2
12/28/2015,Needs improvement. Navigation from chapter screen doesn't work. Can quick rewind 8 secs but skip ahead functionality is missing.  Makes it painful when you want to skip ahead within current segment but can't.,2
12/27/2015,"Each time I open the app to view an offline video, I need to have an Internet connection. Beats the entire point of &quot;offline&quot; videos and a mobile app. Weekly or daily synnc for updates are acceptable but this is just debilitating while on the move.",2
12/27/2015,"How could after upgrade, so many existing useful features get eliminated? It does not look like a serious product any more. It's hard to use. Could you please roll back recent releases?",1
12/27/2015,"The app is great, I can now learn on the go..",5
12/26/2015,If u add speed control like in the web version ill give it 5 stars,3
12/26/2015,"If i play a course off my laptop, switch to my phone and/or tab it does not save your progress. You have to start from the beginning.  Trying to fast forward or skip will flag pluralsight thinking you are trying to abuse the system.  Offline download does not work.  Off my tab, I was able to download and watch the course offline. How can the courses that I have seen offline sync back to online, acknowledging that I have completed that part of the course?",2
12/25/2015,The app is not compatible with their digital tutors sign in.,2
12/25/2015,"Why this program doesn't allow itself to be moved to SD card? It's not a system utility, or part of Android.",1
12/24/2015,Overall the app is ok but you guys over at pluralsight need to design an app that works with tablets too.,3
12/24/2015,"Additionally to all the other problems, how can I delete downloaded content?... After reinstall the delete button is again visible",3
12/24/2015,Can't even start watching the courses on the app without speed controls so I have nothing more to say regarding other features. **Full screen update is an improvement but still can't watch the videos without speed controls!,2

12/22/2015,I LOVE Pluralsight. Amazing content. The latest version of the app has a number of issues though. Top priority for me is the variable playback speed. Some presenters talk so slowly that I struggle to maintain focus at 1x. Please add variable playback speed back into the app ASAP.,2
12/22/2015,Getting better😃,4
12/22/2015,Lots of great improvements in the last few months that make it a pleasure to use. Chromecast support and auto play are great improvements.,5

12/21/2015,Very hard to login.... i had to remove it... it looks great but making an account takes forever,1
12/21/2015,Annoying. Pls fix ASAP,1
12/20/2015,"Really? Best you can do? I haven't found a single redeeming feature. Nothing works properly. Downloads, login, list, search. Not renewing next time if I can't use offline. Now fix it!",1
12/20/2015,"The stupidest app. I miss the previous version where i could watch content offline. Instead of getting better, they took a huge step back and f**** up what was already working well.  Don't know who make these decisions at the company, probably some guy sitting in corner office who's looking at numbers all day long and has no clue about the core product and services.",1
12/20/2015,unusable in offline mode on a Samsun tablet since it requires internet connection while on an iPhone offline mode does not,1
12/19/2015,I am really happy with the update to support casting. It makes it easy to watch the videos on my TV from the comfort of my couch.,5
12/19/2015,"Previous application was working good in my earlier ASUS phone.. Now I have installed in Moto X Play.. My videos are not getting played.  It says 'unexpected error occurred', and nothing plays.. No place in the application where you could configure which media player to be used.  I have MX Player and VLC also.. Running in Android 5.1.1.. Not sure what's the issue...",1

12/16/2015,"The last version broke the landscape mode on my note 3 phone, this makes the video super tiny, unviewable.how can I rollback to the previous version?  I also noted that during the movie there is on the right side , the menu, showing the playlist (for my current course 120 clips), the old app jumped too the current playing movie so that I can navigate more easy, but the new app doesn't jump to the current playing clip anymore 😢",2
12/16/2015,Serious problems with offline courses.  Case 1: Have downloaded courses for offline viewing but wasn't able to play them after the connection was gone.   Case 2: Have cleared the cache. Downloaded courses were gone but icons in the app that tell you if clip is downloaded or not weren't refreshed. App tells me that I have more courses downloaded that I have downloaded for real. Case 3: Can't move downloaded courses to external storage and courses can take quite some space. That's how I got full internal storage while preparing for flight. Case 4: Can't remove downloaded course. But I don't trust myself on that one. I probably just couldn't find the option. Case 5: Changing the playback speed would be nice.,2
12/16/2015,Horrible offline player ...developers of this app please learn some programming lessons from your catalog,1

12/14/2015,I've been wanting to use this for a while but it doesn't recognize my username. I started off with a digital tutors account and figured it might take a while for them to get DT accounts to work but it's been more than 6 months and I still can't sign in. I want to be able to do some on the go viewing and going to the DT website on a phone doesn't make it easy. Would really like to be able to sign in sometime soon.,1
12/13/2015,"Works okay. Although, as others pointed out already, the offline viewing is terrible. Which is frustrating since offline viewing was a big selling point for getting the premium subscription.",3
12/13/2015,Where are my offline files after closing the app?,1
12/13/2015,"This app has working fine, but I should be able to offline view from where I left off not all the way back to the beginning. 12-8-15 Update: All of my offline viewing files are gone and why do I have sign in every time I use this app. Please fix this, it's very ironic that the same things we pay to learn, this team has not fixed.",2
12/12/2015,"useless to me, subtitles is a must!",2
12/12/2015,"While Pluralsight is excellent, this app has had several issues. But they are starting to fix them! Major issues #2 and #3 (forgetting place in video, and next segment not automatically starting) have been fixed! Remaining major issue: 1. It forgets my credentials and loses downloaded courses approx once a week, which is *super* annoying because I use complex passwords and don't have any of them memorized. Please fix!!!",4
12/11/2015,"12/11 Update:  Upgraded from 1 to 2 stars.  Instead of a total POS, it's only mostly a total POS.  The videos actually play now (unlike before).  Downloaded content sometimes plays (my Plus membership is wasted).  On my Note 4, the video only takes up 60% of the screen with black bars on all sides.  Still no speed control.  Still a MAJOR step backward from the old version.   I love PluralSight's content and the new web interface is decent...but they simply cannot get the app right.  Big Fail.  Don't subscribe if your main viewing method is mobile.  PluralSight needs to fire their entire mobile dev team and hire some real coders.",2
12/11/2015,Does exactly what you expect,5
12/11/2015,Keeps on downloading same clip...completely useless..,1
12/10/2015,Actually the phrase I have come up with is 'shockingly dysfunctional'.  Terribly disappointing and frustrating.  AND THE NEW VERSION IS WORSE.  USELESS FOR OFFLINE VIEWING.  PERHAPS THE DEVS SHOULD TAKE SOME OF YOUR COURSES...,1
12/10/2015,New app is pathetic. Seems they have released beta to customer. Not professional work.,1
12/10/2015,Previous new version was bad this is a lot better thank you,5
12/9/2015,Missing the ability to control playback speed.,3

12/8/2015,Downloaded videos required Internet access? No speed control of the video so i cant listen and watch in 2x speed? I thought the old app was bad... But this is not usable anymore,1
12/8/2015,"Previous versions were horrible. Much better now since 2.1.x. Downloads work, but videos play well. It still not that intuitive, could be improved. But at least now it's useable",3
12/7/2015,"Does not work at all, can't download, can't view online. Can use pluralsight PC version only.",1
12/7/2015,Which genius decided that it was good idea to offer offline access but then require Internet connection to watch downloaded material? Makes you wonder if the people making these brilliant decisions have any common sense.,1
12/7/2015,The new version of the app is absolutely unusable. The app gives a server error when trying to view downloaded content so you actually need a connection to the internet. This of course defeats the purpose of downloading content.,1
12/6/2015,"I wanted to believe the comments were exaggerating but quickly found out that this app is as bad as other comments were saying . Ui is terrible, hard to go back once you start playing a video. Also no playback speed!! I mean wow, this is the most basic feature in any and all cbt video players. The iOS version is so much better.  This one looks like an afterthought.",1
12/6/2015,I've subscribed for Annual Plus plan but it keep on stated I have reached my maximum offline video download limits which I didn't even download once before !!!! We demand for offline viewing in case went to outstation without highspeed internet !!! Please fix this ASAP or else we will demand for refunds seriously !,1
12/6/2015,"Can't find the option of increasing video playback speed. Like others have mentioned, i have to login everytime the app is restarted. Without the playback option the video content is painfully slow to watch. Improve or revert!!!",2
12/6/2015,"When my phone restarted, my credentials is not remembered thus I have to redownload all my offline files! It is not user friendly!!",1
12/5/2015,Videos look informative and useful. App was working fine on first run but on subsequent runs spinner just skips spinning. Disappointing.,2
12/4/2015,This new version is brilliant. Thanks for your work. But speech speed feature is gone :( please put it back...,5
12/4/2015,Login prompts very often... Cannot use downloaded content as with every update it errors out on play,2
12/3/2015,"Upgraded version works well on my OPO. Can't seem to find the playback speed option, but everything else works well for me.  I'm sure polish will come, but good work guys keep improving.  If you're considering checking it out, do it and ignore the overly negative reviews.",4
12/3/2015,"Ok if you have internet connection, otherwise avoid like the plague! Previous versions were poor but at least it sort of worked. Now you need an internet connection to watch downloaded courses! I think the Pluralsight developers would do well to take some of their own courses as it would hopefully lead to a much better product.",1
12/2/2015,Pathetic app till date.,1
12/2/2015,Yay for Chromecast!  Please bring back the option to keep me logged in.  It's really annoying to have to log in every time!  It would also be really nice to allow the audio to play in the background while using other apps.,4
12/1/2015,Offline downloads for my commute are now a complete intermittent mistery. Still no download to SD card. No multi speed playback. GUI is now difficult to use and confusing. Never known an app to take such a backwards step. This app is seriously embarrassing.,1
12/1/2015,"Please, return back the previous version or improve the current one. Internet is required to get access to downloaded offline clips ??? I was very disappointed when sitting in the train I realized that I can watch NOTHING from downloaded videos because I had no Internet. The speed playback is removed (yes, it was not perfect on my android device, but at least I could choose before). The video catalog is cumbersome.  The only improvement is that when the video is switching from one to another the play buttons are not popping up, so it's possible to watch all clips one after another without interruptions.",2
11/30/2015,"The 'offline' viewing facility constantly asks for an internet connection... So you can forget about doing training on your commute... It constantly deletes 'downloaded' courses, or more annoyingly, just large parts of them. It's essentially a paid for app as you are paying an extra subscription for offline viewing, you would think that they would use that revenue to make sure the service worked. Given that you have to stream there's better training available on you tube. A very, very bad app.",1
11/30/2015,"New app works great if you have a data connection and enough data in your cell phone plan you don't mind eating.  If you are trying to download and use offline modules, the app isn't with using.  The app has trouble downloading the modules, resuming where you left off, automatically loading the next section of a module, syncing progress with your online account, and requires you to sign in again whenever there is an update.",2

11/28/2015,In new version I am struggling to view list of all trainings.,1
11/28/2015,"Terrible.  I have no audio at all after the update, making this app completely useless.",1
11/28/2015,"Course viewing history and state is not maintained.   Latest version is a large step backwards. I question whether this was tested outside of your marketing division before being released.   Pluralsight, what has happened to you? You used to be awesome.  N9 Marshmallow.",3
11/28/2015,All paid,1
11/27/2015,Added Chromecast. Thanks.,4
11/27/2015,"Improved from the previous release - so given an extra star  But, why can't I browse the library of videos? Surely a fundamental feature? And, why still no Chromecast support on Android? It's been on IOS for over 18 months!",2
11/27/2015,Cant use my digital tutors account to log in which makes this app useless. The web interface works so will stick with that.,1
11/27/2015,Apperetly the login only works for pluralsight accounts. Which makes no sense.,1
11/26/2015,"This is a nice updated app compared to what it was when the fist gen version was released. Also love the Chromecast implementation. I love watching the courses on TV and taking notes on my laptop at the same time.   Wished that the app - once started, and the tablet is in landscape mode - the app stays in landscape orientation and no change to portrait orientation.",4
11/26/2015,This is the only app that asks me every day my login and my password. Please fix this ASAP.,1
11/26/2015,"Hooray Chromecast, and it's now working the way I would expect. Thank you. I've been looking forward to this for a long time!",5
11/26/2015,Can't sign in because I'm registered with Digital Tutors.. Even though it's a Pluralsight now,2

11/26/2015,"I was trying to login but app says that my password is wrong,but I can login in the site with same password and username",2
11/26/2015,Works ok but loses track of where I've got to in a course.,3
11/25/2015,"The only issue is the search results that don't match the web version, but besides that it is perfect!",4
11/25/2015,1. Doesn't remember search when using back key after selecting course. 2. Removes search results after scrolling down through them.,3
11/25/2015,nice work!!!,4
11/25/2015,"Now it has chromecast support, cool :)",4
11/25/2015,To many bugs you better stick with watching in the web for now.,2
11/25/2015,Chromecast with autoplay :),4
11/25/2015,"Removing features for the sake of new look? Very, very bad decision!",1
11/25/2015,Huge improvement over the old app. Makes watching pluralsight videos that much more enjoyable.,5
11/25/2015,Much better than before,4
11/25/2015,"I've been through many iterations/phones with this app, all useless. Galaxy Nexus = audio stutter & unusable. Nexus 5 = audio stutter & unusable. Nexus 6P = some highlights...you can't watch a course from where you want to, only where it wants you to...when you do play from where YOU want, at the end of the app it just stops and the video slider is at a random point in the video, making you think that it has stopped suddenly...and today all my offline videos are gone! I could go on but out of characters!",1
11/24/2015,"Fundamental feature is missing: autoplay. Once done viewing with a clip it does not start automatically the next one. In the player, it even does not show list of the course content so that you can manually start the next chapter. Video in a full screen mode is not a full screen and there is no speed selector.",1
11/24/2015,This app is terrible.  Downloads are difficult to find.  The design of the app makes it difficult to navigate anywhere.  You need to login every time you open it. My downloaded content will not play.  This app is worthless.  Very disappointed.  I pay $50 a month I expect your app to work.,1
11/24/2015,"It is of very pool quality, while downloading does not show the progress, does not have the same  comprehensive look of you downloads,etc. People who wrote this and released, should go on one their courses",1
11/24/2015,Offline feature is not working.,2
11/23/2015,Come on guys....I love Pluralsight but this app should not have been published. You teach us best practices and go ahead with this??? While watching downloaded content it appears you still need some connection of sorts or you experience playback errors. In addition to that there are no playback settings; table of contents is empty when viewed from the player; unable to navigate to preceding or following sections....need I go on?,1
11/23/2015,Pluralsight have a great model and content however since redesign of the app it's hopeless,2
11/22/2015,Thanks for the chromecast support,4

11/22/2015,"Cannot see the table of content in the video player, no content loads. No auto play, moving to the next video in the course is a pain.",2
11/22/2015,Would be good to get the speed controls,4
11/21/2015,"The Pluralsight app offers an excellent user experience with offline playback and Chromecast support.  I started a learning group at work where we sit around the projector and discuss the lessons a few days a week.  I also participate in Coursera, Udacity, and Edx; however Pluralsight is better targeted to the specific needs of my employer.",5
11/21/2015,"Love the update but can't find the playback speed controls for the videos, please fix.",4
11/21/2015,Title says it all. This should of been released as an alpha it's that buggy.,1
11/21/2015,So much better!,5
11/21/2015,Many issues but why on earth would you sacrifice the ability to search via video CATEGORIES...what a stupid board decision your executives have made!,1
11/20/2015,"Seriously? Chromecast support before fixing so many fundamental bugs? I was enthusiastic about giving the new app a chance. But after several weeks of being signed out, off line not working, downloaded courses being deleted and needing redownloading, player not remembering where I am in a course, inexplicable crashes and PS not knowing when I have completed a course. Pretty fed up! Sort it out Pluralsight. You are not a cheap product!",1
11/20/2015,"Source of learning for all, yet the way app is designed - seems dev is still learning. After each update downloaded courses are vanished or untraceable. Need great improvement with UX.",3
11/20/2015,Nice revamp,4
11/20/2015,Have to go to table of content to play each video! That's every 2min for some courses... But it sure looks pretty.,2
11/20/2015,"App should work in landscape mode on a tablet. (Samsung Tab S) Fortunately video plays  landscape. Lots of other bugs reported here. But the most annoying one is the inability to seek. If you navigate away from the app, it will not remember where you were. Also where is some basic functionality while playing video on a tablet. No ability to see where you are in a course. No ability to browse back to course selection. On a tablet all this must be provided in menus on screen. Need a slider on the left for functionality.",3
11/20/2015,I have an offline subscription but it doesn't matter when the app logs you off and doesn't have cached credentials. I've also experienced downloaded courses missing when offline.,1
11/20/2015,"This used to work with a Digital-Tutors account, but it stopped working! I will not give it a better rating without me having the ability to sign in!",1
11/19/2015,"Used the old app for years with little or no problems. In the new app, the offline mode is unusable. It would be nice to be able to downgrade until the new app is production ready.",1
11/19/2015,With the latest updates videos finally play. Cannot get videos to use full screen though. There are huge black borders around the video just wasting space on my Nexus 5.,4
11/19/2015,After a clip it randomly plays another clip from the first module of a course which makes it unusable.,3
11/19/2015,Devs. I dont know what happened to your QA but this app is useless to me now. All downloades courses are lost if you restart de app. The offline mode doesnt work anymore bexause it asks you to sign in. And there is no way yo REMOVE a course! And its been weeks without a fix. Am i the only one that used offline mode?,2
11/18/2015,"This is the first review I have ever wrote for any app but the frustration with this new one is too big to keep quiet. As previews reviews said this is just look over substance, and the look is not even that great (in fact it hinders usability, e.g. the playback controls in the middle of the screen are a very bad idea, I've accidentally pressed them countless times, jumping to next video and back wasting bandwidth...) And why is the speed selection missing? Do developers even try to use the app they write?",1
11/17/2015,Offline mode is buggy and I have to sign in every 5 minutes,1
11/17/2015,The new app does not support offline access. I have downloaded courses that will not load when not connected to a network.,1

There also seems to be a bug with chapters getting stuck, so it constantly flips back to the wrong chapter when coming to the end of a clip.",1
11/17/2015,"1) When playing a downloaded course, at the end of each clip, instead of advancing to the next one, it goes back to a random clip near the beginning of the lesson. 2) And now I cannot play any downloaded course.

11/17/2015,"Still has many problems that make it extremely difficult to use. It's very frustrating and pathetic that you replaced a working app with this load of rubbish. I can't believe I paid extra for premium to be rewarded with an awful video player that keeps going to the start of the playlist after every clip. I am writing this review while on my commute, as again, I was too frustrated with the app and have given up trying to watch on it. It's ashame I can't give it a lower rating.",1
11/17/2015,No speed controls yet..  Videos come small on big screen..  Other minor issues,2
11/16/2015,The old app had just started to handle downloads correctly; then it gets replaced by something with a whole set of new problems. The new app has less functionality and bugs such as jumping between episodes which makes it difficult to use. Worse it repeatedly loses downloaded content making it useless for my commute. PluralSight are supposed to be software experts? It costs twice the standard subscription to use offline content - we should be able to view that content,2
11/16/2015,1) When a video is finished it will jump to a random video. 2) No way of knowing which video I'm watching. 3) No way of knowing which videos I've already watched. 4) Resume starts at beginning of video.  UPDATE 5th Nov: *With the latest update it crashes when the video starts. *Must sign in every time app starts. UPDATE 10th Nov: Still crashes when video begins. UPDATE 11th Nov: *Doesn't crash anymore. *Reinstalling fixed log in problem. *Still jumps to random video.  This makes it unusable!,1
11/16/2015,I can't watch courses that I have donloaded offline. Previously I could and now on the new app I cant,1
11/16/2015,New version doesn't work properly,1

Chapter list and on-screen overlay no longer indicate currently playing clip. &quot;Resume Course&quot; starts from very beginning of course instead of actually resuming from last viewed point. All these features existed in the old version and are now suddenly gone. Also, now they are releasing daily &quot;updates&quot; to make recent negative reviews appear outdated. WORST RELEASE EVER.",1
11/16/2015,What a mess - this new version looks good but functionality wise it's a big step backwards,1
11/16/2015,This new user interface is not good.,1
11/16/2015,So the new version now plays videos however it doesn't want to roll over to the next video but starts playing the first vid over and over. Bit embarrassing from a company that has dozens of mobile app development tutorials.,2

Please add back playback speed controls.  -Ability to either pause downloads or restrict data use to wifi only is also missing.  -Starting playback in the middle of the course results in first chapter being queued up after the end of the clip played.,1
11/15/2015,The old app functioned. This one does not. I want a refund for the entire company after you released this crap. Maybe if your going to charge more for premium features you should perhaps make sure they work,1
11/14/2015,I kinly ask you for downgrading app until new version will work also in offline mode. I payed for this services and now can not use it as I planed &quot;offline during travels&quot;.  Also speed control is missing that waste my time. Thanks.,1

When you finish watching a single part of a module, the app moves to a random track in the course instead of the next track. If that's not enough you can't remove courses from your device once you're done with them, even if you're critically low on storage space. I'm not sure this warrants a 1/5 rating, but my prior rating was a 2 :-/",1

11/11/2015,"Uninstall old style version first and install from scratch!  Unbelievable but it doesn't work when upgrading from the old version (pre v2 - or the old style). When the app was upgraded the issues I faced were:   1) Previously downloaded videos had been removed!   2) Had to repeatedly sign-in to the App   3) Downloaded videos would only work for the current session i.e. would an error &quot;An unexpected error occurred&quot; would display if you attempted to viewed a video that had previously downloaded and had to sign-in again - perhaps an authentication type error?  So, by trial and error I uninstalled and then re-installed the application and everything seems to be working as expected - albeit you have to download videos again.  Not a great way to &quot;upgrade&quot; the application by not being backwards-compatible!",3
11/11/2015,"Downloaded offline courses don't work at all. Please make a simple and working app, we don't care about funky one.",1
11/11/2015,Video player doesn't work on my nexus 6. Good design though,1
11/10/2015,What happened? This app is useless if I can't watch courses at a quicker pace. I am actually shocked that this feature was removed.,1
11/10/2015,Please give me my old app.This is waste of time.doesn't remember where u had left.course deleted automatically. Don't waste time n bandwidth downloading courses and this app,1
11/10/2015,"After years of android neglect they've revamped the app, its much better now. Still a few niggles but overall better.",4
11/10/2015,Downloaded courses gets deleted arbitrarily. Offline doesn't work when using VPN without internet connection.,1
11/10/2015,Latest app iteration is a joke... a very bad joke. Less is _not_ more.,1
11/10/2015,Very sad... You can not watch download module if you are offline. I really don't get it... the purpose of downloading module is for watching them when you can not be online. Unfortunately you can not use the application when you don't have Internet connection.,1
11/9/2015,"Still no chromecast support, and the app doesn't even use the full tablet screen when rotating.",4
11/9/2015,"Still buggy. New version is even more limited on Android platforms. No playback controls, just pause and play.",1
11/9/2015,Basically doesn't work offline.  No speed control.  No back button(!).  A serious step backwards.  Really embarrassing.,1
11/9/2015,"Pluralsight, you have such a brilliant team of speakers with you. Please ask one of them to fix your app. This new update has ruined whatever good was there in the older version. Since this morning, I need to login every time and even then videos don't play. When videos used to play, they were not in order and I had to manually select the right video once one finished.",1
11/8/2015,"With so many excellent tutorials in the library i can't believe pluralsight is unable to produce a decent app. Offline player keeps crashing on a weak connection, you can't choose where on your phone the courses should be downloaded, and I have not found a way to delete stored courses on a video per video basis. You can't help but thinking they don't care, and give you a least effort app with basic features missing and lots of unstabilities. Shame on you guys...",1
11/8/2015,The application doesn't work on my nexus phone. I can't event go back to home page it just keep crashing,1
11/8/2015,As looks like other one.,3
11/7/2015,"The old app was much better than this one. No way to know where I am in a course. If I stop and try to continue later, it starts from the beginning. So frustrating.",1
11/7/2015,"No playback speed controls and no chromecast support. Why would I use an app when the website offers more/better features? Only useful feature is the ability to download and view courses offline, but it's simply not enough.",2
11/7/2015,It keeps starting back at the same lesson.  It doesn't seem to record that I'm 15 lessons lady that point.  They're is no way to mark three lessons completed manually either.,2
11/6/2015,The old version was fine this new improved version and I use the word improved loosely. Unable to download for offline view shows as Downloading but don't work and you have to keep signing in every time. Not sure who your devs are but I suggest they take one of your courses in how's to make apps...,1
11/6/2015,Please add this feature. Without it I'm going to have to find another tool for my online training.,2
11/5/2015,"1- where is the control for the video playback speed ? That feature is capital to me. 2- The videos aren't totally full screen. On a 5in screen, that's most important. 3- From a bookmarked course I would like to go to the course home page. Navigation could be improved.",3
11/5/2015,"I like new design and you have some good content. But there is loss of functionality in new release. And it is a big deal for me. New App: doesn't show what module I am playing right now; doesn't show which modules I've seen and which modules I haven't; no longer able to increase speed of replay which was very useful, because done lecturers speaking very slow; more difficult to browse courses.",2
11/5/2015,"This new version does not work in offline mode. I have downloaded a couple of courses,and every time I try and play a downloaded course I get 'unexpected error'",1
11/5/2015,This program tells me I'm not connected to the internet. So it can't show my downloaded content. Eh???. My subscription is a waste of money because the only time I can use these courses is when I'm traveling.,1
11/5/2015,"Cant play downloaded videos. No way to browse by category. This is not ready for beta and should not have been pushed to all users. Cant believe they rolled this into production! But hey, it looks great.",1
11/5/2015,"In the Table of Contents, you should replace the &quot;...&quot;  indicator with something more meaningful.  As a user, I would like to know if I have completed a clip.",1
11/5/2015,"I have been trying to use this application for close to a year, and when it works it is fantastic! However, each time I try to use this mobile app it is a roll of the dice because half of the time it doesn't play videos... Even when I have downloaded courses because my connection is sketchy! It often does not work with downloaded courses!",1
11/4/2015,"I like the direction of the new UI, but this was not ready for users yet. So many bugs from a few minutes of usage.",3
11/4/2015,Removes already downloaded courses. Only lists new courses. DO NOT UPDATE.,1
11/4/2015,Any chance we can get this back and working?,2
11/4/2015,Several features removed. It's full of bugs. It's horrible that Pluralsight treats customers like this,1
11/4/2015,Crisp an clear content,5
11/4/2015,Where is the option to delete the downlodes modules? And playback speed option?,1
11/4/2015,Downloading courses to local device is a huge mobile data saver. Excellent course content. Needs Chromecast support.,4
11/4/2015,"This new app does not support most of the functions I could use in your old application. Video playback is taking 80 percent of the screen real estate and there is no way to go to full screen, video navigation is placed awkwardly at the top of the screen, there is no way to speed up playback,...  What is this a beta test? I rarely if ever write a bad review, but this is a major disappointment.",1
11/4/2015,Does not keep track of your progress when you've downloaded a course and follow it.,4
11/3/2015,Hate this app,1
11/3/2015,"Good job everyone, I can finally watch videos in landscape mode without the audio sttuering the whole time. Offline access works perfectly for me :).",4
11/3/2015,This is a nice app but is missing the playback at 2.x speed.  Now it takes for ever to go through the content.  People talk to slow when presenting.,1
11/3/2015,The new app is unusable. Very hard to nevigate. Cant access all courses. Can't download a part of a course. Cant download the content to the external micro sd card. I would like to have The same functionality of the Web page .,2
11/3/2015,Fantastic rework. Much needed and well done.,5
11/3/2015,"5 stars if the full screen issue is fixed. However, currently the video doesn't expand to fill the screen.",4
11/3/2015,Where is option for sign up or registration? It's incomplete of registration is possible only via web.,3
11/3/2015,The new version has lot of improvements and new features. It syncs your progress and shows the list of bookmarks. The missing part is recommendations which is quite important.,4
11/3/2015,"It doesn't download reliably, courses which have been downloaded vanish from the list. It jumps around all over the place. I  can't find a way to delete what it has downloaded. Perhaps the app developers need some training :-)",1
11/3/2015,Do you guys even use the app? Horrible release. Watch some pluralsight vids about UX and product development!,1
11/3/2015,"I doubt I'll ever be able to get through a course without increasing playback speed. I love them, but I NEED to speed them up.  For a subscription service ABOUT coding and tech this should not be missing and other issues surprise me as well...",1
11/3/2015,I am unable to view videos using this app. Always get unexpected error occurred message and nothing is shown but loading.,2
11/2/2015,The new version circa October 2015 is missing key functionality.  Deal breaker.,2
11/2/2015,"Ok, so, everytime it tries to download a clip longer than 20 min it crashes. This on a Galaxy S6 edge. Also, I cannot find how to delete downloaded modules. I don't want to download the whole course!",2
11/2/2015,STILL no Chromecast support.  No course progress tracking by module as in the old app. Hitting the download buttons more than once downloads the same clips more than once. No way to remove downloaded clips.  I had to uninstall app to delete clips.  Please bring back the old app.  This one is too painful.,2
11/1/2015,"The new app is looking much better but have some issues (on nexus 6): 1. When I'm watching one of videos of the second module the app jumps to the next video by the sequent number but at the first module and I need manually got to the next one in currently watched module. 2. I can't delete separate video/module, only all the videos of the course. 3. Can't find the video speed manipulation controls. 4. Overall the app is not really intuitive - for example I've spent some time till the delete video button fou",3
11/1/2015,"Audio stutters when device is in landscape, can't follow any tutorial like that. Newest app doesn't even have category browse!!!",1
11/1/2015,It's rebuilt from scratch and this is the trash that comes out of it. AND STILL NO CHROMECAST.......... time to find some new developers.,1
11/1/2015,No option to speed up the (sometimes very slow talking) video. The app doesn't remember where in a video I stopped. Videos not always using the full screen Etc... Good trainings though.,2
11/1/2015,"You've fixed login problems, and the new app is pretty and functional both. Well done!",5
11/1/2015,I love Pluralsight! Just hope the app can support Chromecast in near future!,4
11/1/2015,"Major usability problem with the new version: you can see newest courses and the most popular, and search, but you can't Browse Courses or even categories. This isn't a problem if you already know what you're looking for, but course discovery is tough. This is IMO a basic feature and it's puzzling that it's not available here.",3
11/1/2015,"The new design is way better than the older one, and the latest update fixed the issue with the opening. Keep up the good work! :)",5
11/1/2015,"The new version has removed lots of features. Firstly it removes all your downloaded courses. Secondly you can't control the speed to have to listen to all the videos in a slow drawl. It also no longer tells you which clips you have watched already. You can't stop the downloads so if you are on mobile connection it will eat up all your data. Unremitting garbage. They ask us to 'hang tight', how about you finish development before realising such dross. Will be cancelling my account.",1
11/1/2015,The new interface is missing so much that this app is pretty useless to me. Might as well use the website and Chrome. Can't stop downloads of courses when they start and videos don't have categories in the app if you're looking for a particular subset of videos.,1
11/1/2015,"No features, no speed, unable to view navigation, no cc, in short a total downgrade",1
10/31/2015,The video playback has finicky progress controls. I have to press multiple times to get to a new position. Also the course progress is missing because there used to be a green tick in the list views,4
10/31/2015,"Update: While the new version is a much needed reboot of Pluralsight's cripplingly out-of-date Android app, I still experience constant buffering while watching any of the videos on a 150Mb connection. I do admit this could very well be caused by a third party bottleneck in my route to Pluralsight's CDN, or even by Comcast themselves.  Videos only play for 30 seconds or so before stalling and rebuffers. The 2 stars are for Pluralsight's great content, not the app. Do yourself a favor and watch on a PC.",3
10/31/2015,Pluralsight gave completely new look and feel to this new version of application. Videos on mobiles offer better quality. Yet I'm missing landscape mode for tablets.,4
10/31/2015,The old app was pure garbage so I was glad to see they made a new one from scratch. The new one is also complete garbage.,1
10/31/2015,"I've been waiting for this update for a long long time and the new version is a huge improvement over the last version. Sure there are still things that could be improved, but overall it's a much better in app experience.",4
10/31/2015,Why did you remove the speed control? And if you have a new version why didn't you added the cast option it's basic for video streaming app...,1
10/31/2015,For the new version. Previous version was far better.,1
10/31/2015,"From what it looks like, the app is doing significantly better, but still waiting on chromecast support. Will update again when I get that feature.",3
10/31/2015,The application update available on 10/30 has fixed the issues with Kit Kat 4.3. App works wonderfully now. Thanks for the update. It does not crash when launched and I was also able to watch a video successfully and navigate the new UI. Thanks.,5
10/30/2015,New interface is slick and fast,4
10/30/2015,"This app is just complete garbage. I guess it does its job but it doesn't offer a single nicety of any kind. Why for example can't I stream these videos to my TV? Or even create a watching list, etc. UPDATE: New version, you Still can't stream to TV, are you freaking kidding me??  And no speed controls on videos, Jesus you guys are thick!!",1
10/30/2015,Won't start on my Nexus 5 with Android 6,1
10/30/2015,Since latest update app crashes on opening hence no longer usable.,2
10/30/2015,The new version  is good,5
10/30/2015,After the update it doesn't work Amy more. It crashes when I try to load the app.,1
10/30/2015,New update is broken. The app crashes whenever it is launched.,1
10/30/2015,"Pluralsight has the best training material for advancing my professional career. The app, when it works, is pretty good. Offline viewing is a must have feature for commuters. Periodically however videos unexplicably won't play and it can be infuriating trying to get rhe app to work again. It seems to need a good network connection even for offline viewing which seems a bit odd. Needs better error handling and messages.",4
10/29/2015,New app much beter then old.,4
10/29/2015,Better!,5
10/29/2015,"There is no playback speed in this new version. Why not? Playback speed &quot;jerks&quot; when offline, the playback button keeps popping up and blocking videos",1
10/29/2015,At long last it is possible to switch off the screen and continue listening to a course... I have been waiting for this feature for soooo long. Thank you.,4
10/29/2015,Not working - simply crashes,1
10/29/2015,"Mobile Test - Note4: need to be able to view courses by category instead of search only. Search doesn't work well, it needs to preserve previous criteria to avoid retype. Search results gets reset after few seconds annoying :(. W/o speed control and full screen mode it's not worth my time. Please improve ASAP",3
10/29/2015,"Just updated to the new pluralsight app, the one &quot;built from the ground up&quot; only it does not actually work and crashes every time I try to open it, gives the error &quot;not responding&quot;. Annoying that I can longer watch videos from my phone and paying 50 euros a month for this!! Not for much longer if they don't fix it.",1
10/29/2015,App is not working it says unfortunately pluralsight has stopped,2
10/29/2015,The new version of this app is a vast improvement over the older app. Not tried the download course feature yet so 4 *,4
10/29/2015,Most of the things i was waiting for are there now. Just needs chromecast support,3
10/29/2015,"I saw low stars for long time now and recent update were given stars but seems its still awful. I see new bad ratings coming in. May be i dont understand the app well but i am not able to view the offline videos i downloaded on my tab. It just keeps popping error. I shudnt have to be connected to internet to view offline videos, right?",1
10/29/2015,"It's definitely a step in the right direction. There are however several key features missing. The first one I noticed is the lack of ability to control the playback speed (1.25x/1.5x/etc). Many of these presenters are talking sooo slow, so not being able to speed things up is wasting *a lot* of time.",3
10/29/2015,Update removed offline files. New app ux isn't intuitive. Can't tell which clips have been viewed. Speeding up video playback is no longer possible. So unhappy. I want to go back to the old version.,1
10/29/2015,No landscape support on tablets,4
10/29/2015,Fails to start on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 running on Android 4.2.2,1
10/29/2015,No history or bookmarks. Unusable without the website,1
10/29/2015,"As others have mentioned, and as I have written to Pluralsight support team; the app does not stretch to full screen (try watching a Powerpoint slide cropped on a small high-res screen, not going to happen), and there is no way to cancel downloads (not good if you're leaving the house and it's still going). Pointless to use on a mobile device unless stretch to full screen isn't enabled.",2
10/29/2015,Now synchs across devices and from web history. Fantastic stuff!,4
10/29/2015,"I love the new look off the app, but I miss the ability to adjust the play speed. Please add this function again.",3
10/29/2015,"I love the new app however it doesnt work on Tab 3 , i really need to see it in my tablet big screen",3
10/28/2015,Edit: with the new release - all issues taken care of. Kudos!,5
10/28/2015,The new app is MUCH better than the old app. But still no chromecast support? As soon as it's added I'll be switching to 5 stars.,4
10/28/2015,Video speed options no available in latest version,3
10/28/2015,New app is a huge step forward. It still doesn't appear to support Chromecast though. This glaring omission caps the app at 4 stars.,4
10/28/2015,Great app,5
10/28/2015,"Now that my phone has 64GB, I have plenty of room to store offline, and the app finally works as expected.",5
10/28/2015,"The latest update with the new ui is a welcome improvement. I do have one issue, there appears to be no way to cancel a module from downloading. This is especially an issue when I clicked download course and wasn't able to cancel. I was on wifi but needed to leave my house and didn't want to download the entire course on mobile data.",4
10/28/2015,No more problems with video playback.,4
10/28/2015,Can't login to the app. Not providing source files for basic subscription is just wrong.,1
10/28/2015,No captions available,4
10/25/2015,"Been a longtime subscriber, andriod and chrome browser user primarily.  All players they provide for those platforms are highly disappointing. The android player is constantly locking up &quot;checking permissions&quot;,  i have recently reduced my subscription due to these issues.",2
10/25/2015,Always checks the permission. There is not enough function. The site is better,2
10/25/2015,This should come with the lower cost subscription.,3
10/25/2015,Like,4
10/25/2015,"The app is hard to work with. Keeps getting stuck at checking permissions, uninstall and reinstall helps for a while, then again problems even while I stayed checked in. The navigation is drag. Just a long list of courses, some really outdated (XP) and no distiction between dev, it pro and graphic design etc. Could ve a lot better. The courses sometimes are ok, yet very basic. Better take a real course.",2
10/24/2015,Crashes on open after logging in to account.,5
10/24/2015,Cannot log in. Same credentials work on main site. Shame.,1
10/24/2015,"Doesn't play videos, just spins endlessly.",1
10/24/2015,Good for techno geeks,5
10/23/2015,It works fine and seem very stable.  On my GS5.,4
10/23/2015,I am able to study anywhere I go.,5
10/23/2015,Download doesn't work properly and takes a lot of time to load video.,2
10/22/2015,Doesn't always sync progress with website especially when viewing offline. Doesn't remember which video I was last viewing. Periodically refuses to play any videos without giving any kind of error. Videos don't resize to utilise the full screen size (on a Galaxy Note 2). But when it works the content is excellent.,3
10/22/2015,"Can't watch, KEEP CHECKING  FOR PERMISS",1
10/22/2015,"The basics of video playback seem fine for me (on Nexus 5), but it could really use more features e.g. I can't  seem to access my accounts bookmarks or playlists. It could also really do with an option to download modules for offline viewing.",3
10/21/2015,Would have rated 5 stars if sound is not choppy,4
10/21/2015,Crashes a lot!  Doesn't keep track of where you are in courses. Pluralsight could and should do a lot better. Sound now breaking up during offline viewing. Unable to shut off screen and leave audio running.,2
10/21/2015,Exactly what I need to watch these tutorials anywhere. Thank you.,5
10/21/2015,Can't even login with my digital tutors account. Works fine on PC...,1
10/21/2015,"Why such a business who is supposed to be a leader, come up with such a crap application? Explain please!",1
10/20/2015,"Bookmarks would be useful. Also, I cannot watch fullscreen (I.e. Without notification bar etc) on Xperia z5.",4
10/18/2015,Licence check issues on lollipop. Unstable,2
10/17/2015,"Cool app, sound is lag on full screen",4
10/17/2015,Video stuck on check permission. App need to improve since it's suppose to be technology training company,1
10/17/2015,"Can't view any course, always get &quot;Category not found&quot; or &quot;Course not found&quot; error message",1
10/16/2015,"The service, content, and website are fantastic, but the app could use some polishing and feature addition.",3
10/16/2015,"I like pc web version and recommend content, but mobile app is BAD. Full screen is not FULL screen, a lot of real estate is wasted. Intermittent voice cracking, on PC works fine, so it's this app. Does not have shared course history between pc account and app account. When finishing topic and auto resuming play next one toolbar jumps in and never auto hides, you need to click on the screen every few minutes to hide that. Nexus 5, Android 6.0,",1
10/15/2015,Before I am able to see videos and even am able to download it to see it in offline..... But now when I browse for any course... The app stops at the stage saying... Checking permissions. Being a paid version it should not have basic problems in browsing.. Many are facing the problem like me.. Please resolve the issue.... I will give full stars to you,2
10/15/2015,I get a lot of buffering. Tested my connection @ 30Gb/sec. This app downloads @ 56Kb/sec.  That while paying close to $50/month.  The math just doesn't add up. Raise the band width and I'll change the rating.,2
10/15/2015,"Only landscape view is a bit hanging, but rest is great!",5
10/15/2015,"App has problem with downloading modules its just spinning and says &quot;checking permissions&quot; never come back or download. Also offline module when you horizontal to see full screen, its has black space both side and display vedio only in small square that frustrates while watching.",1
10/14/2015,"A good way to learn on the go, no bells and whistles. Wish I could use full screen though.",4
10/12/2015,Needs to be integrated with account info on website; i.e. bookmarked courses should be easy to find but aren't.,4
10/12/2015,Vedios are not loading at all.  Checking permissions and then the spinner keeps on going does not load at all.  Please fix it.,1
10/11/2015,Credentials are not working; and no it's not user error,2
10/11/2015,Works smoothly,5
10/11/2015,"Updated review: I am no longer able to view any content.  Also, might not be the right forum, but any chance we might get history | bookmarks from the mobile platforms?",1
10/11/2015,great working,4
10/10/2015,"This app help me study the lessons from the very beginning of the day, i really like it because it's simple and easy to use.",4
10/9/2015,Awesome App,5
10/9/2015,Videos never play on the app.,2
10/8/2015,"Love pluralsight website but this app is terrible. Unpolished, feature-light and doesn't do the one thing that most people want it to do, play offline content - even though it claims to! All you ever see is a continuously spinning loading icon. Moreover, the app will still download the content even though it won't play and everytime you open the app it'll try to download it again, even though it already has it. Absolutely hammers a data connection as the videos are not small, and for absolutely no benefit. If you're thinking of buying a subscription so you can learn in your own time away from the office, say on the train. Don't!",1
10/8/2015,"As much as I love the professional courses provided by pluralsight, I hate this player. You have to turn your phone in order for it to go in a hybrid fulscreen mode, which is just as bad. Laying in bed while learning makes this a real pain. Then you have to Tap after each increment on the video just for the enormous play button to disappear, which is extra tiresome and distracting. Offline viewing is somewhere in the app, but it never, ever worked. Premium courses, half assed app",1
10/8/2015,"Like, download progress status blocks courses info, can't move out that bar either.",3
10/8/2015,Allowing pinch to zoom on video would be useful as it's hard to see code. Syncing bookmarks and watched videos would also be nice.,3
10/8/2015,Pluralsight is a great service but the android app sucks! The interface is awful and it would be great if you could play the audio in the background or while the device is locked.,2
10/8/2015,Screen lock option should be there and video does not cover full screen of mobile .,4
10/7/2015,"There is no sync with my account on the Web. There is no access to account features. There is no easy ways of filtering narrowing down content. And not to mention the performance is poor. Videos start skipping on full screen at 1.5 speed on Nexus 6, but works on portrait mode. Only that cannot see well due to size. Autoplay sucks on my iPad. I would like to see features from some of the best video players out there, screen lock while playing, better controls or maybe let the user choose a player.",2
10/7/2015,"Mobile devices are what I use, the app doesn't allow me to play your videos. Fix please",1
10/6/2015,"The subscription model works  great for dedicated students, not so much for busy peeps like me. So get your boss to pay for it! Lots of great tech content from industry leaders!",4
10/6/2015,Offline viewing feature is very beneficial.,4
10/6/2015,Pluralsight charge extra for offline using this app and it is useless. Fails to download and online content stutters. Failed to work on Samung Tab and Sony Tab also Mototrola Phone so pretty naff. It take talent to produce such a poor performing app perhap they should take one of the courses to learn how.,1
10/5/2015,Otherwise it's good to have on Android,1
10/5/2015,"I like pluralsight the company, and I highly recommend their content. I also like their web browser experience. But this app is minimal and lacks a lot of features. It doesn't load your dashboard or bookmarks. It doesn't load your history from the browser version, only history of videos on the phone. With all the acquisitions and funding, you would think pluralsight would improve their mobile user experience.",2
10/5/2015,"It would be better if I could figure out how to run the videos fullscreen.  Also, when a new chapter starts, the play/pause overlay does not go away without me dismissing it.",4
10/5/2015,Checking permissions. Can't believe I pay monthly for this crap. Time to look elsewhere,1
10/5/2015,Won't work on both my Sony tablet and lenovo phone. Both hang on &quot;checking permissions&quot; on courses. Very disappointing.,1
10/5/2015,Chromecast support would be nice,3
10/4/2015,Won't download content. Won't play videos.,1
10/4/2015,"Hi guys, seems like you have quite a critical bug here, vould you please fix as I do a lot of my watching on the move...",3
10/4/2015,I am completely satisfied with the content and the user experience of the app. Keep going. Kudos,5
10/4/2015,Ive not been able to download a single course. Just randomly stops downloading. Useless.,2
10/3/2015,Doesnt have chromecast support. Booarking courses and many others.,2
10/3/2015,Great application.  Now I can update my self on the go.,5
10/3/2015,A++++,5
10/3/2015,This app needs a complete make over. Nothing works. For a $500 subscription per year you'd expect better.,1
10/2/2015,"I could not see the code cleanly while trainer was trying to explain in IDE. App should make use of full screen effectively just like youtube. Also, I am not sure why admins restrict users to only 4-5 offline courses. It should be unlimited based on the plan he/she subscribed to.",2
10/2/2015,Great and updated contents.,4
10/1/2015,great app,5
10/1/2015,It is very good. Please add support for Google Chrome cast so videos can be casted.,4
9/30/2015,"When viewed in landscape mode, the video tends to stutter. Even though the connection is on a Wi-fi or 4G connection. Why is this the case?",2
9/29/2015,Very poor streaming,1
9/29/2015,Videos do not load. &quot;Checking for permission&quot; is all that shows. $30/Month for this?,1
9/28/2015,"The videos and playback quality are perfect, but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that the Bookmark function wasn't integrated. Fullscreen button also needs to be implemented in order for mobile users to know that the fullscreen option is there. While it was easy to discover for experienced users, I'm afraid it might be a little bit of a problem if a new user didn't see a button to expand to fullscreen (horizontal).",4
9/28/2015,Downloaded offline videos do not play. Once I delete the downloaded content and play the course online it works like a charm. It's a steal to market a functionality that absolutely does not work !!!!!!,1
9/28/2015,Can't find bookmarks..,3
9/28/2015,The app with no update for bugs,1
9/27/2015,Doesn't play anything. Keeps saying checking permission.,1
9/27/2015,The programmers best friend.,5
9/27/2015,This is crap!,1
9/24/2015,was working when i first install it. but not anymore,2
9/23/2015,Ethernal Checking for permissions and cant seenithing,1
9/23/2015,when it doesn't re-login,5
9/22/2015,Very simple navigation and UI. Not to mention the great content this sight offers.,5
9/22/2015,I mainly use it to watch videos on the way to work and quite often try to download just before leaving home. Many a times the download would simply stop for no reason and would need resetting. Not a big issue but is frustrating when you're in a hurry,4
9/22/2015,I like the app but it would be great if there was more information about the different series such as date of publication.,4
9/22/2015,"Don't know if it works for anyone else but on my nexus 6, all I get is a screen checking for  permissions! Shocking for a company that wants to teach me how to write Android apps! Sort this out.",2
9/21/2015,Used to work,1
9/21/2015,A good way to do some training on mobiles and tablets. The previous version of the software was hanging on my mobile trying to check permissions. All resolved now.,4
9/21/2015,at last offline data are protected from clear-caching,5
9/20/2015,Could not get the sub title in the mobile app.,3
9/20/2015,Really good app,4
9/20/2015,Would be great if there is an option to mirror to Smart TV.,4
9/19/2015,"This app is very poor. Lack of options, problem with cache.  i use subscription without download option now and even 4G internet abroad is very fast and streaming works ok from other places the pluralsight app struggle.",1
9/18/2015,Something changed and all videos are choppy. Its not my signal because it's full. I used to watch videos with no issues. Can't even use the app anymore.,2
9/18/2015,No updates since Feb,1
9/16/2015,"Superb way to get access to the PS library while on the go. There are only two things I don't like about the app. 1) Can the video controls automatically &quot;retract&quot; around 1-2 secs after a video starts, like VLC does? It's very irritating to have to keep clearing the controls every time a video starts. The PS vids are often very short, sometimes only 45 seconds and it's very tedious to have to clear away the controls every time. Poor user design. 2) Could the number of modules in a course be shown in search results, this allows you to budget for your offline allowance while selecting your latest batch. Otherwise you have to click to download, watch it fail, clear some out, try again! Or you have to go to course, count the modules and then work it out for yourself! Ridiculous for a modern app to expect people to have to do math on such a simple set of data you already have available inside the app.",4
9/16/2015,Does what it should.,3
9/15/2015,I cant login using app.  The web login works fine.,1
9/14/2015,Offline viewing feature is great!,5
9/13/2015,"Can search for video, can even download for offline viewing, but as soon as I try and play, online or offline, it just pops up course not found, and returns to browse/search page. Website works ok for same courses so I know the course is there and available. Please sort this out, without offline viewing on my tablet, I will not be able to devote time to training.",1
9/12/2015,"If to maximize the video, the sound starts breaking, and it is very difficult understand it.",2
9/12/2015,"I see no way to access my bookmarks through this app, or add to my bookmarks. Without bookmark capability, navigation is a nightmare. Please add this functionality.",1
9/11/2015,"Stutters, very limited caching capability. Worthless on my metro commute that occasionally goes under ground.",1
9/10/2015,Still needs a lot of improvement :-),3
9/10/2015,Works great.  No issues so far.  Gives me access to everything I can do on a pc.,5
9/10/2015,"The app is simple and easy to use.  The real reason for my 5 star rating is the quality and quantity courses offered.  Show up for the free trial period, stay for the value.",5
9/9/2015,"Works sometimes, can't seem to offline sync properly, not really sure if it tries to sync over mobile or wifi. This product could definitely be done better.",2
9/9/2015,Can't play or download videos anymore.,2
9/8/2015,The App is close to being useless as the video player freeze when you click to watch a training course. Also all offline downloaded videos are deleted when the app restarts n struggling to get any use of it when on my daily commute. Hope there is an upgrade soon to fix these issues?,1
9/8/2015,Never loads video. Cant download videos. Can't watch anything. Please fix it.,1
9/8/2015,Audio is chopping when turned to full screen in landscape mode. History is not synced between devices. It could be much better,2
9/8/2015,"I wish it synched lessons between the desktop and app. You can search, and find your location, but it's not I your recents",4
9/7/2015,I commute daily and like to keep a couple of courses stored locally to watch but it randomly removes part or all of a course,4
9/7/2015,To both add a bookmark and view bookmarks,3
9/5/2015,Always stuck on checking permissions...,1
9/5/2015,No syncing of bookmarks,2
9/5/2015,Have to reinstall often to get videos to work.,4
9/5/2015,When you come back to this app..it stays in loafing mode,1
9/5/2015,Great app!,5
9/4/2015,Very useful app. One suggestion: Please add the functionality to cast to Chromecast.,4
9/4/2015,I love PluralSight but this app hasn't worked in months. I sure wish they would fix it.,1
9/3/2015,I used to be able to get offline content but not possible anymore,2
9/3/2015,To download offline videos,3
9/3/2015,Not able to login with my credentials.,2
9/3/2015,"Considering what pluralsight preach, they certainly don't practice it. Super frustrating experience on mobile. I wont be renewing my subscription. I hate companies who either outsource their app development to Indian University first years or who have development teams that don't contain a single person who has an android device. There's no way a developer with any dignity would knowingly let this app get published with their name attached. Want to see what's wrong with this app? Try using it for 6 seconds.",1
9/3/2015,"I used Pluralsight a while ago when I worked for a different company and the audio stutter issue was there and made the app unusable. I've changed companies, got a new account and guess what? Yep, still there. This needs sorting ASAP. People are paying good money for a terrible service. People of Pluralsight: Would you be happy to pay for something that didn't work out of your own money?",1
9/2/2015,Awesome access to courses. Choppy audio playback and downloads hang. Needs work to make viablev mobile app,3
9/1/2015,Can't even open the app. Instantly crashes,1
9/1/2015,Maybe they can take advantage of their own courses and fix this.,1
8/31/2015,Download content for offline viewing? Once you try to view offline the content deletes and you start over again. Works fine on iPhone. Online viewing is crappy and eats data. Please allow us to watch offline.,1
8/31/2015,Definitely worth it,5
8/30/2015,"Does not work, poorly designed. Been that way for a while now....",1
8/30/2015,It is impossible to watch a video in full screen mode.,2
8/29/2015,I love this app,5
8/29/2015,Audio runs non - disruptively.,3
8/29/2015,Congratulations to the entire team for the revolutionary mobile edition..! I am very happy to be a member of Pluralsight. Most of the users not aware it's completely on membership based edition. This app is  not useful for a free member registration - Mubash,5
8/29/2015,"The course I'm in the middle of just shows me a spinner without ever starting to play, and when I choose new courses, it just says 'checking permissions' and nothing more happens. Very disappointing for a service that I actually pay for! :-(",1
8/28/2015,Used to work well.  It's been a bit over a month and a half ago that I last used the app successfully.  Now just stays at checking permissions.  Using a Samsung Galaxy S5.,2
8/28/2015,"Simple and effective. Had a slight issue with checking permissions, but a remove and install fixed it.",5
8/28/2015,"Need some UX design.  Multiple times I move forward or backwards a modules.  Sometimes de downloaded videos,  start downloading again while I'm in 4G killing my plan. It should had an option to restrict streaming only in WiFi",3
8/28/2015,Always struggles to download. Once stuck won't restart downloading till reinstalled,2
8/27/2015,Training client,5
8/27/2015,Need more user friendly,1
8/26/2015,"Would love to have the total time of the course showing up in search results as well as when am in the course screen. We currently have the module wise time in the details page. Really appreciate if this small information can be included in search and details page, it will help in planning for the day. Another wish list item would be having a share option, so that we can share a course link with friends. Thanks in advance.",5
8/26/2015,working again,4
8/26/2015,Just what I needed,5
8/26/2015,Got stuck on checking permissions. Reinstalled. Now play just keeps spinning an downloads stock on 0%. Very disappointed.,1
8/25/2015,"It's a start, but needs Chromecast support",3
8/25/2015,"I love Pluralsight's content and their WebPlayer is great, but this player has a few small issues that make it less than awesome. If I haven't used it for a while I have to log out and log back in to view videos. Also when a new segment starts there is a big pause icon in the middle of the screen; you have to tap the screen to get it to go away. Segments tend to be a couple of minutes long so every 2 minutes I have to tap the screen. It often stutters a bit rather than buffering correctly.  Little things but they add up.",3
8/24/2015,This is a great way to make pluralsight a mobile study guide,4
8/24/2015,"Good courses but app not working properly, hangs frequently while watching offline videos, the part that most interest me because of my long commuting.",3
8/23/2015,"Good updated materials. The app can have some improvments (e.g. sync with the web site, better player and materials access), but it is quite goid if you want to learn on the go, offline.",4
8/23/2015,I can browse course and load the lessons but only see a &quot;checking permissions message,1
8/23/2015,"Missing bookmarks, manual screen rotate/lock, offline mode (I'm a plus member), smaller steps for playback speed, etc.",1
8/23/2015,Annoying that it stops playing when I lock the screen.,4
8/22/2015,"This app works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro. In addition, Pluralsight is excellent for learning and studying for my certs! Love it!",5
8/22/2015,"Buffers all the time on my Droid Turbo.  Internet connection is +25mbps down, definitely not the bottleneck.",1
8/22/2015,"For customers with a limited subscription, (such as I have through a deal with MSDN) you should have an easy access button to show/search content I HAVE ACCESS to. I don't want to search content and click launch to then find out &quot;not available with current subscription.&quot; UPDATE:  Reduced to one star--just realized that it's literally impossible to find the content that I have access to. The app is literally a slap-in-the-face to those with limited content subscriptions.",1
8/22/2015,"I have downloaded few modules for offline viewing, and then when I started off, the load icon spins for ever and it started to download the contents all again . please improve this, its such a waste of our time and the internet.",3
8/21/2015,Easy to use,5
8/21/2015,This is not the usual fare we get from Pluralsight. The UI is cumbersome and lacks many of the features available from the web site.  Please refactor!,2
8/21/2015,"I initialy wrote that the app is not working (checking permissions) however, I logged out and in again and it works :-)",4
8/21/2015,"I'm not sure why you are not given access to your bookmarked videos, that is the feature I use the most on the Web site.",4
8/21/2015,I was really hoping to have a little more functionality.  It would have received another star if I could directly access my Playlists so that I didn't have to look through the courses each time.,3
8/21/2015,And great company,5
8/20/2015,Not sure what happens. It stopped working a month before. Still couldn't get it working.,1
8/20/2015,Perfect,5
8/20/2015,Can't watch or download for offline mode.,1
8/19/2015,No longer works. Endlessly spinning checking for permissions. Can't download to play offline.,1
8/19/2015,I cannot plays videos. The screen is stuck on message &quot; checking permissions ..&quot;,1
8/19/2015,I reported this issue to PS over 6 months ago. They said they are working on it. Obviously they lied. Are you guys going out of business? Why else treat your paying customers like they do not matter????????,1
8/18/2015,Very good,4
8/17/2015,"Odd that the iPad version has Chromecast support but the Android version does not?  Also wish it could sync progress between my various devices.  **Update August 2015**  Want a good pluralsight User Experience on your Android device?  Skip this app, visit the site in your device browser!  It's superior in every way -  no progress syncing issues, Chromecast support, better streaming performance.  Clearly the development dollars are going towards their site UX rather than the Android app",2
8/17/2015,ok,3
8/17/2015,Regular glitches that only seem to be fixed by re installing,2
8/17/2015,Lags one the internet which can play youtube 4k videos smoothly...,1
8/17/2015,"This is pluralsight, but still it is the worst app ever. Even students of pluralsighr could build a better app.",1
8/16/2015,Most of the time it doesn't work,1
8/16/2015,"The viewing experience on a tablet is not that great in landscape mode, it seems to have a slight lag. I use it in portrait mode, trying to ignore the distracting menu underneath. Also, viewed courses on desktop are not synced. Despite all of these, I find it useful to keep learning, even when you're not at the computer.",4
8/16/2015,Wanted to use this to continue a course I started on my laptop. Does not even update 'recently watched' never mind save the position you were in the course.,2
8/15/2015,"Two big issues: 1. When i pleay videos they work, but are only fluid when in portrait mode, if i turn the phone in landscape it begins to lag... looking at the time bar, one second of the video takes about 2-3 seconds. These were downloaded videos, not streamed, but same thing happens when streaming as well. 2. When viewing a list of videos, always after one video the pause butten remains on screen. I have to turn it to landscape and then to portrait again to make the pause button dissapear.",2
8/15/2015,I downloaded few modules such hat I will watch them offline. But when I watch them which is fully downloaded and saved then the voice is flickering it is keep breaking I can not understand single sentence. This is very poor and bad I am no more using app. I wish if they could fix this issue. Because maximum time I wish to watch cached modules to save my data.,1
8/15/2015,"Despite being logged in with a working account, I can't watch anything. Everything locked with the message: checking permissions",1
8/15/2015,"Constant issues with connectivity, offline content doesn't work, heats my phone up like crazy",2
8/13/2015,It would be perfect if I could see my playlist.,4
8/12/2015,"I can search for videos, but can't play them! I just keeps showing me the screen with the text: Checking permissions. I've checked that im locked in, and it shows me that I am. Can't even play the videos i've watched before on my phone :-(",1
8/12/2015,Stuck on checking permissions. Very frustrating.,1
8/12/2015,Sometimes it seems as if the audio can't follow the video. This occurs mostly with videos that have a +5 minute playtime.,3
8/11/2015,"Update: doesn't work anymore - stuck at checking permissions all the time, every video.  Pro: works fine for its core function. I like the playback speed ctrl. Sync progression by segment. Con: would like sync with bookmarks from the site.",2
8/11/2015,Must have for developers,5
8/11/2015,Have managed to download some content for offline viewing but that content does not play. Just gives me an endless spinning icon.,1
8/10/2015,Its quite good.but a bit slow.,5
8/10/2015,Offline options is very useful.,5
8/9/2015,"Good App. Still few more things need to be done to be great. 1. Ability to view the history within the app 2. Keyboard shortcuts to pause, play, increase/decrease speed etc 3. Ability to resize the contents and player windows.",4
8/9/2015,Needs Chromecast support for android.,3
8/9/2015,Performance issue,2
8/8/2015,BAD,1
8/7/2015,The app needs an update. Bad.,1
8/7/2015,A few fairly major issues (occassionally have to reinstall to log in) but the videos are brilliant and having them on my phone and tablet makes this still a good app even with its failures,4
8/7/2015,I have been using the android app for Tablets ànd phones. Recently the sound quality has made the apps almost unusable. 1) tried multiple courses 2) quality via browser on pc or smart TV is ok. 3) even cached offline quality is poor for both Tab and mobile. Please fix whatever change is made recently for content delivery to mobile devices. Feature: ability to create local or global list...sort of play list queue.,3
8/6/2015,"Every video I try to watch, the audio starts skipping. It does it if I'm streaming or playing a downloaded video.",1
8/6/2015,"Landscape view doesn't play video,  cannot play bookmarked courses,  videos act like you don't have an account. Cannot play any videos from app.",1
8/6/2015,"I have an annual plus account, bought like 2 months ago, was working fine and all of a sudden it keeps saying I don't have permissions to watch anything. This is really annoying since I need the app cause I'm always on the road.",2
8/6/2015,"Since the update, so much better, video doesn't skip, content downloads much faster offline.. a much better experience",4
8/6/2015,Please add the access to playlist,4
8/5/2015,I have downloaded courses to view offline but it always crash after watching for couples of minute,3
8/5/2015,Try to follow Android courses from Pluralsight and make a great app.Good Luck!!,1
8/5/2015,"Though content is great, the android app sucks, every time I  have to uninstall and install to get correct permission as per my subscription",1
8/5/2015,Audio is impossible to listen to on LG G3 due to constant dropouts. No option to buffer ahead for when away from wifi.,4
8/4/2015,No issues whatsoever!,4
8/4/2015,"The pause button stays on the screen when watching multiple clips, you have to rotate the display to get it to hide. Very annoying! It's failed to connect to some lessons, and on occasion locks up, not what I expected from a paid content provider.",3

8/3/2015,IPad version is so much better,1
8/3/2015,Please add a list for favorites videos and favorites courses,4

8/2/2015,More offiline videos wud b grt,5
8/1/2015,"Doesn't run from where the session was paused. Takes forever checking for permissions, never really got out of that message. Download does not work. Only positive is convenience of accessing from mobile.",2
7/31/2015,Please let me specify whether I want to use my phone's storage or SD card. Agree with others comment on able to lock screen.,3
7/31/2015,"For a company offing software engineering training, this application is poor.  I've had to re-install it several times to  get the downloads working again.  Even when they do work, it can take days to download a course.  I've just reinstalled it again and again the downloads have frozen at around 8%.  I doubt they'll be downloaded by the time I need them.  The UI is poorly thought out, you can't search and then download a whole course because it just starts, you have to find out the name, then guess the category and scroll for it.  It's had sound problems, sound cutting in and out, making it unusable on some courses.  Guys, sort this out, it's got to be an embarrassment for you.",2
7/31/2015,Chromecast support would be nice as well as a face-lift,4
7/30/2015,The controls should disappear while watching the video they hinder the he video screen and are a little annoying,3

7/28/2015,Great player and download functionality provides flexibility while traveling.,4
7/27/2015,"Good product, wish I could sleep display and just listen as with podcasts.",2
7/26/2015,Very nice app but the UI can be better.,4
7/26/2015,"If Chrome cast option is provided, this will be an awesome application",3
7/25/2015,"Disappointing app. I expected a functional app, not just a limited and sloppy offline player",2
7/25/2015,You can't read code on the small phone screen making it useless for most content. Please make the videos zoomable when paused.,3
7/25/2015,So far it's working good enough for me.  Just had one crash so far and I had it running for over a week.,4

7/22/2015,I like the training material would like to have the presentations and limited offline courses etc included in the basic plan. Also pluralsight is missing important features like lists and good history etc. With current competition they may be fine not not geared for future very well.,3
7/22/2015,I tried to download couple of modules on my xiomi redmi note and it is still downloading since last one month. Note a single module has been downloaded but it still shows that I have downloaded 24 modules.,1
7/21/2015,"It's nice to be able to access Plural Sight courses on a tablet, but why doesn't the video fully buffer before loading? It gets so bad sometimes that I can't understand the speaker. Video player needs improvement",2
7/21/2015,It do the job but is not that cool,3
7/21/2015,The app is fine the serice is Great,5
7/21/2015,Great knowledge base,5
7/21/2015,Works great. Thank you.,4
7/20/2015,Still can't use this with my valid subscription through my Digital-Tutors account.,1
7/20/2015,Great,4
7/20/2015,interface should be better,4
7/19/2015,need help my plan stil acitivate. i cant play video its something wrong,1
7/19/2015,Audio/Video Skips,2
7/19/2015,Very poor....app doesn't start at all..... No reply even if reported multiple times.,1
7/19/2015,"actually, the webpage(even mobile version)is better than this app",4
7/18/2015,"Overall it fits the purpose of deliver the video tutorials, but... 1. Sometimes the video and the audio slows down and is choppy; 2. The pause/play controls keep popping out in the middle of the screen in the middle of the lessons, causing continuous interruptions; 3. I'd like to see the ability to sync the history with the account and not only the lessons watched on the device.",3
7/18/2015,"1. No bookmark access, nevermind playlists. 2. Audio/Video stutters like crazy, making lessons unwatchable directly on device, downloaded or not. 3. No Chromecast support for watching lessons on TV while following along on computer/laptop.",1
7/17/2015,Rebooted my tablet and it still won't work.   Now I have to uninstall this app & re-download all the great courses.  Above review is from 2/8/2014.  After reinstalling it worked great for while.   Now on 3/29/2014 the app is misbehaving again.  So I'll uninstall & reinstall.   I'm confident it'll work beautifully for another 2 months - before having to be reinstalled.  PluralSight has really great content.   I would definitely recommend them.  But just wish their Android app didn't have to be reinstalled every 2 months.   Its 6/4/2014 & I'm uninstalling & reinstalling yet again.  And 7/9/2014.  And 9/9/2014.  And 1/26/2015.  And 3/9/2015. And 5/8/2015. And 7/17/2015.,4
7/16/2015,Easy to use Off line mode is very handy If you want to learn - this is simply perfect. (On nexus 5),5
7/16/2015,"Too often I find myself with a couple of minutes spare, and with this app I can download the course of my choice and study on the go! Excellent app for those hardcore developers who want to keep picking new skills.",5
7/16/2015,Mobile app doesn't have my bookmarks or playlists. Probably the most  important two things for anyone to have. App is headed in the right direction but just isn't complete.,1
7/16/2015,Audio hangs when I want to use in full screen mode,3
7/16/2015,Checking permissions... I haven't been able to use this in weeks even though I'm logged in with a full annual subscription.  On top of that when I favorite or view a course online I still have to search for it in the app... Like the app is a whole separate product. This makes the experience pretty cumbersome and not at all convenient.,1
7/16/2015,"Being able to view pluralsight videos offline is great for my commute. LOTS of room for improvement though.  Going full screen causes the audio to become incredibly choppy and unusable. Keeping small screen makes watching far harder.  No history syncing is very annoying  Whenever it goes onto a new video, the overlay comes up over the video and takes ages to disapear. Have to pause and play, then hope the 5 seconds of visuals werent important, especially as i have to play in small screen because of full screen issue above.",2
7/16/2015,can't download subtitles,4
7/15/2015,I can't browse my own subscriptions. No bookmark feature. No offline viewing option.,3
7/15/2015,"I have an old Samsung Note 3. Unlike all other app on this phone that plays audio or video, in pluralsight the audio is choppy and barely understandable at 1.0x and useless at any higher speed.",2
7/15/2015,"Ugly, outdated interface, but it does what it's supposed to - plat videos.",4
7/14/2015,"In order to load for offline viewing, you need to briefly view part of the course before viewing it in the &quot;recent&quot; tab. The button doesn't work in other views.",3
7/14/2015,I definitely  recommend.,5
7/14/2015,Stuttering audio makes this very unpleasant to watch/listen to on my phone via WiFi. The real kicker is that I can watch the videos with no stuttering via the Chrome browser.,2
7/13/2015,Every time I tried to download it stuck.App has option to resume download but doesn't work. Only solution uninstall and reinstall app.,1
7/13/2015,Really basic to the point of being pretty much useless. Can't access my play list which makes it useless.,1
7/12/2015,It would be better if there is some feature similar to other video player,3
7/11/2015,... Is showing player controls. I must hide them every time when the player goes to a next part of the video. Really annoying!,3
7/11/2015,The app needs a huge overhaul. It's just painful to use at times.,2
7/10/2015,Need to be able to bookmark courses within the app. Also would be nice to be able to organize those bookmarks. I'm shocked the app doesn't sync course progress or recently viewed between devices.,3
7/10/2015,Ok,4
7/10/2015,I would like to be able to make personal bookmarks. And the progress is not synced with courses that I watched in a browser. Overall OK player for their courses.,3
7/9/2015,"No bookmarks, no progress. Basically this app is useless unless you never use the website.",2
7/9/2015,Please fix android audio shuttering issue at 1.5 or higher speeds,2
7/9/2015,"All attempts to watch my previous videos, as well as any new ones fails consistently.",1
7/9/2015,"On Moto G Android 4.4.4, if I rotate screen to landscape (which would allow me to see the code in the video better) then the video starts buffering and the audio gets really choppy as to make the video useless. I have to rotate phone back to portrait to hear audio, buy then I can't see video. Overall pretty useless on this phone.",1
7/9/2015,Video could be buffered better to play smoother.,4
7/9/2015,Decent app with a decent interface,3
7/9/2015,Crashes all the time.,1
7/8/2015,Top app,5
7/7/2015,The video streaming is poor,2
7/7/2015,Will have to uninstall to try get it working again. also have perf problems when using 2x speed...,1
7/5/2015,"Nicely designed, user friendly",5
7/5/2015,"Audio keeps skipping in the videos, it's basically unusable.",1
7/3/2015,"This app is nice to have when you don't have a full computer to work with, however, it didn't bring in my saved modules j want to watch",4
7/2/2015,Doesn't work. Just sits on checking permissions.,1
7/1/2015,The app works well and has been invaluable for when I am traveling and don't want to use up my data plan. The only complaint I have is the use of UI elements that date back to Android Donut. They need to update the UI for Holo and Material design. This would make the application feel more consistent with modern devices.,4
6/30/2015,Pluralsight is great but this app is lacking. At least need access to bookmarks and playlists.,2
6/30/2015,Can use anywhere anytime,5
6/29/2015,Video playback is choppy making the app unusable. No sync. Several bugs. Little information in search on each course.,2
6/29/2015,Auto complete search a bit unresponsive. Pause button and progress bar does not disappear automatically,3
6/29/2015,"An OK video player e.g. keeps track of how far into a series you are. However a couple of things nag me a lot. 1. The app ignores if the device has screen rotation on or off - it just rotates. Particularly annoying when in bed where I do a lot of watching. 2. When a new episode in a series autostart the headsup display, including eg the pause button, reappers every time. Removing it is a mere double click on some empty area however as the individual episodes are often just some minutes it becomes a pita.",3
6/29/2015,This app doesn't sync with your online account.,3
6/29/2015,"Excelente APP, incluindo 30 offline modules!!!",5
6/28/2015,Course progress is not synced between the site and the app.,3
6/28/2015,"I found lots of issues like not getting latest video in search result. Many issues with offline videos. Hard to get right video list using search. Each time load the app will take long time to get on main page. Pluralsight as good company can do better then what current app is. When they have such nice video library, why cant thry try to make this app as more easy and interactive as one of their video cpurse ?",1
6/28/2015,Good app..it would be great to have crime cast support for android. It's missing sync as well.,3
6/28/2015,"I have valid annual plus subscription , every time trying to use this app, it's generally not usable",1
6/28/2015,Unusable. ...,1
6/26/2015,Would be better if I could access the playlists and bookmarks that I have on the site.,2
6/25/2015,"And recent doesn't show my recently viewed courses either. I've already searched and built a long list of bookmarked course that I want to watch, so I have to do that again to use this app?! Surprisingly amateurish. I just use the web site on my tablet or phone.",1
6/25/2015,So terrible.,1
6/25/2015,Horrible app..,1
6/25/2015,The app likes to go into &quot;checking permissions&quot; mode on a weekly basis.  This constitutes the need for a complete uninstall and reinstall to resolve.  Fix it so we quit losing our bookmarks! [Galaxy Tab S 8.4 & Galaxy S4],3
6/24/2015,Every time i search the app dosnt find any available videos to show and there is no sync with my web history.,1
6/24/2015,Unable to play or download anything!,1
6/24/2015,The tool is out date but content is great. So I am not sure I am giving 4 star but definitely I like content! Tool require development. Also Please consider to make it Andorid TV compatibility.,4
6/23/2015,Does not work,1
6/23/2015,Still lots of buffering and stop starting,2
6/23/2015,Good app,4
6/22/2015,Still a great app. Have a bit of stuttering from time to time but no real gripes,5
6/21/2015,Fantastic little app that lets me learn on the go.,5
6/21/2015,"If all you want to do is ensure you have access to videos while commuting without relying on a data connection, it does the job",4
6/21/2015,Nice app for training. I like the offline feature for plus members. Makes it easy to get training on the go...,5
6/20/2015,Very happy to see plural sight as an app. Very easy to learn on the go. Nicely  categorised.,4
6/20/2015,speed of downloading the courses for offline viewing over wifi is very slow.  Othewise the courses are good.,2
6/20/2015,No update since February? Ouch. Needs material design as well.,3
6/20/2015,Nice one,5
6/20/2015,Good,4
6/20/2015,It is crashing when I launch training,1
6/19/2015,No bugs that I could find...  just needs more focus on usability,3
6/19/2015,Allows me to watch videos offline and save bandwidth..,4
6/18/2015,App is adequate for viewing streamed courses but the offline viewing has a major flaw - viewing progress is not synced back to the server so you can't see what you have or haven't already watched on the website. This fundamental feature request appears to have been outstanding for a long time on the Pluralsight forum. I cannot understand why this has not been implemented.,2
6/18/2015,The full website shows some great filtering and allows you to access your account and playlists. Would be nice if this app did. Would like to watch a video in my playlist.,3
6/18/2015,Why even bother with an app if it makes it harder to view content than just opening a web browser. Pretty embarrassing for a company that specializes in tech tutorials,1
6/18/2015,"The video lags and gets distorted in Offline mode. Online videos are ok, nothing great about the app.",3
6/17/2015,Says video has downloaded then **tries to download using mobile data** Downloads don't play half the time Playback extremely choppy on 1.5x  and above No option to save to memory card No access to account bookmarks or playlists Interface a bit dated Not the worst app in the world but I'd expect better from a company that teaches how to make apps Biggest problem is downloading on mobile data without asking,2
6/17/2015,"On the plus side, all courses from the website seem to be available so it is handy to run on the tablet while following the demos and workshops in full screen on the desktop. There are a few negatives though - the Recent tab does not sync with courses you've run started on the desktop, so you have to find them via search - when you do find one though, it does retain where you left off on the desktop; the video loses the buffer when you pause so on restart you have to wait on rebuffering,  which does not happen on the website; the app can be a bit flaky and crash for no reason; search is basic and doesn't allow sorting or filtering and the tags used on the website are not available - you really need to know the full name of the course you're looking for if it is a popular subject.",3
6/17/2015,Great app. Download for offline play. Excellent cost.,5
6/16/2015,"I have been paying for pluralsight for a while (back to when it was trainsignal).  There has been no improvements to this app and that is bad since you all probably provide training for apps, too (drink some of the kool-aid).  I would like to see an improvement in the near future or I might have to close my account.  Please include syncing across the web and apps, too.",1
6/16/2015,I can't cache any videos for offline viewing.,2
6/16/2015,Good application but download is very slow and gets interrupted frequently,3
6/15/2015,Great app! My only problem is that it doesn't quite seem to sync where I was previously watching from a different device.,4
6/15/2015,It doesn't sync with new courses and there is no zooming,1
6/14/2015,WONT EVEN LET ME LOG IN TO MY ANDROID APP,1
6/14/2015,"It would be nice if the app synced recently viewed so I could keep track of my progress as I switch between devices. I prefer watching on my tablet, but at times would like to use my phone.",4
6/13/2015,"This app has two functions: allowing users to find content and playing that content. Content doesn't really seem organized in a meaningful way. I have to search and hope I find what I want. Playback is decent with a few crashes and audio/video sync issues. Additionally, the playback multipliers don't work very well and often lead to choppy playback.",3
6/13/2015,This app is too basic needs some work,3
6/13/2015,"Earlier it use to work in my old devices.  Today when I tried it is not working.  When I Click on any course it remains in checking permission screen. Waited endlessly,  no use.",1
6/12/2015,up. Not good on my HTC One M8 Android.,2
6/12/2015,App is good when have data connection available but unable to watch videos when offline. Previously it was there don't know why developers remove that option..,3
6/11/2015,I'm not sure how they can charge as much as they do for subscription and have such a terrible app,1
6/11/2015,Superb and very convenient to use,2
6/11/2015,Keep crashing on me.,1
6/11/2015,Easy to get stuff and use alongside laptop,4
6/10/2015,I bought the subscription i cannot view the videos even after downloading the modules for offline viewing. Please fix it. Sinc is not good.,4
6/10/2015,When I try to use it again it doesn't start the videos. Works if I reinstall it every time or sometimes if I keep trying for several minutes.,2
6/9/2015,It says checking permissions and won't play video.,1
6/9/2015,No Chromecast support,2
6/8/2015,I can't understand why you provided offline features if it doest work offline.,1
6/8/2015,Learn on the fly ..good app ..though no offline buffer for the vids,4
6/7/2015,Sometimes work and sometimes require t restart... Android 5. Sony Xperia z3,2
6/7/2015,"Who writes and tests this app? It never ever works. After updating, it loses cached credentials, the videos never play, or download.",1
6/6/2015,Using it all the time.,4
6/6/2015,Great training and ease of use,5
6/5/2015,I need an app that works the app constantly says that I'm not authorized to view any of the courses it sucks balls,1
6/3/2015,Stuck on checking permissions,1
6/3/2015,Please adopt the device screen rotation. Overriding this and always turning tbe screen is extremely annoying.,1
6/3/2015,Very useful app,4
6/2/2015,Make it Chromecast aware please..,3
6/1/2015,Application is not nearly as polished as other offering's.  Does not sync progress across multiple devices and does not provide Chromecast support.,3
5/31/2015,"The app is easy to use and linked to your Pluralsight account. All history and progress is saved. Would've gotten 5 stars, but app didn't update the course after completing the last video... so progress stuck @ 97%.",4
5/31/2015,I'm a paying member and haven't been able to watch via this app. Sometimes it will play for a few seconds and then stop and other times it just won't play at all .,2
5/31/2015,Strange issue of Pluralsight download every time the offloaded course again and again.,2
5/31/2015,"This would be a 5 star app if I could rely on the offline modules. However, it seems to only download a small percentage of them and frequently delete anything cached",3
5/30/2015,El mejor entrenamiento a mi alcance. En cualquier lugar y a cualquier hora.,5
5/30/2015,For tech training it is a joke to have a broken app,1
5/29/2015,Rock tech with this training,5
5/29/2015,Good. UX Could be better.,4
5/28/2015,Great to have the plural site content available on mobile. Studying from the best of the best anywhere anytime.,5
5/28/2015,Please enable full screen videos.,4
5/26/2015,I have no issues. It works and is pretty intuitive. Note 3,5
5/26/2015,The least expectation of a user is sync.. Atleast app must sync with web history. I hope it is in under-development.,2
5/26/2015,Although Pluralsight is a fantastic platform for tech education this mobile application is ridiculously bad. Please improve it or take it off Google store.,1
5/26/2015,Please add chrome cast support to the app so that I can watch it on my TV. Right now the code is not readable on mobile screens. Update: I subscribed to monthly version but cannot access courses on mobile.,3
5/26/2015,"This is a promising app, but I can't use it due to the choppy audio reported by others. This needs to be fixed! Update: One year after, and the problem is still there.",1
5/25/2015,I used the app on my Samsung tab 4 and it worked seamlessly. The user interface is easy to navigate and is intuitive.,5
5/25/2015,I use this app almost everyday. It's user interface and performance are excellent. I have not found any issues with this app so far. I highly recommend this app to everyone who love learning technology through video.,5
5/24/2015,It has a good library. The playback experience could use a slight improvement otherwise I am a happy customer.,4
5/24/2015,Cannot play Video when playing online. We have to download a bog course to see a sample :|,3
5/24/2015,Otherwise it works as it should. Never had a problem. If it had better integration with my account I would give it 5 stars,4
5/24/2015,"The training provided by pluralsight is great, with loads of great videos, so if you are looking to learn about software development then get a pluralsight subscription. The app is ok, I use it purely because my Internet connection is a bit slow at home and the website can take ages to load, so having the app and being able to download the video helps. However, it's a shame that synchronisation of your history and progress isn't better.",4
5/23/2015,Great to be able to learn on the go.,3
5/23/2015,"-1 not working with slow connection, -1 offline support, -1 didsfunc caching",1
5/22/2015,"It used to work, and now all it does is crash upon launching, even after rebooting my phone.",3
5/22/2015,Video could take a bit more space on screen to be truly full screen,4
5/21/2015,Nice app very easy and use friendly,4
5/20/2015,Freezes sometime app will not load videos. Already had to install it 3 times,2
5/19/2015,The content is good but the developers of this software are doing the content providers a huge disservice by not fixing the performance / choppiness / delay / buffering issues.,2
5/18/2015,"I like the content of pluralsight but the app's choppy audio is very frustrating. I find rotating the device helps for about a minute. Given how bad this app is, it makes me second guess the quality of teaching they are providing.",1
5/18/2015,Has my login info correctly. Just sits there checking permissions.,1
5/18/2015,I've had to reinstall this twice because the app doesn't think I have permissions to view the videos...hmm now I can't search,2
5/18/2015,"I just can't use this when lying down, phone rotation is supposed to stay locked when off. S5 android phone.",2
5/17/2015,The audio is choppy and the phone gets hot in landscape mode. Unusable as a result.,1
5/15/2015,Very poor quality app especially from a tech company,1
5/14/2015,"Pluralsight is a wonderful resource, yet the mobile app is severely lagging behind the site in features and overall user experience. I would gladly increase my rating should this change in the future.",3
5/14/2015,"I haven't used the app for some time now because at the course view, the video just sits at, &quot;checking permissions&quot; and never loads.",2
5/14/2015,I was expecting it to work with Chromecast. Does not have my history from the site too.,3
5/13/2015,Excellent!,5
5/13/2015,Awesome application,5
5/12/2015,Above 1.5 speed setting sound is unusable plus if I press on/off screen button the app stops. What if I just want to listen to the videos and save on battery? In the side pop up menu (which is very nice idea) you can only see part of the title and the menu covers part of the video. What if I like to have them both on at the same time?,3
5/12/2015,PluralSight offers really good training on a wide variety of topics. This app needs to provide a way to cancel downloads,3
5/12/2015,Very nice resource for developers.,5
5/11/2015,"Fantastic app for me, not worried about what other people think about this app, makes it even lovelier bcos I can study on the go with my note 4 while I'm away from my computer. Keep up the good job guys.",5
5/8/2015,"After updares it stops to be usable, cant dow load content and cant watch videos. BUT -  clearing cache and data on app and it gets usable again. With offline downloads too !",4
5/7/2015,It would be nicer if play lists are available,3
5/6/2015,It would hav been better if we had an offline version,5
5/6/2015,"Will either hang, or just keep on trying to validate license. While on laptop the video will work instantly. May be their idea to force you to higher subscription level.",1
5/5/2015,"Poor performance especially in full screen play-back. Please fix performance issues, as the content is really great.",2
5/4/2015,Needs Chromecast support,3
5/4/2015,The courses are great but the player can use some serious reworking. Support bluetooth play/pause buttons. Enable progress sync between devices. Reminders would be nice too.,3
5/4/2015,"Offline viewing doesn't work well, set several things to down load and hours later they still hasn't started downloading. Chromecast support would be good.",3
5/4/2015,"No chromecast support for Android, but you do have it for ios? It also needs support for playlistz from the website, and the overlay doesn't go away when videos change unless you touch the screen. I will update the review as issues are fixed",2
5/3/2015,Having trouble viewing content. I check all my streaming apps and they work fine but not Pluralsight,4
5/3/2015,I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and since I upgraded Android device to 5.0. The application just keeps crashing...use to work. I can't even open the application. I have gotten no response from the tech. Support...I will give more stars when it actually works,1
5/2/2015,Videos do not load in android lollipop please update,5
5/2/2015,"Great app and a must have for any IT fan, geek or processional!",5
5/1/2015,Works very well on my phone and tablet,5
4/30/2015,App is good to track. But while playing videos it crashes a lot.,2
4/30/2015,Can't login,3
4/30/2015,App isn't working....,1
4/29/2015,Can't access almost all videos. I have a Monthly Plus membership which entitles me to view every video on the  PluralSight website but I cannot access practically any video in the andriod app. Deleting.,1
4/29/2015,I love the fact that I'm able to access training from anywhere especially the gym. Now I don't feel like I'm taking time away from training when I'm out. but the UI for navigating training is really bad and not very usable. Additionally Plural has allowed me to take my career further than its ever been beeing a polyglot developer. Hower the lack of modern java coverage and lack of scala coverage makes it seem like jvm technologies are no longer important. I love pluralsight but it could be better,4
4/29/2015,Sometimes I have to logout and login again to be able to download videos. Video overlay reappears between sections and I have to touch the screen to make it disappear again. Also some syncing and the ability to do the assessments in the app would be nice.,3
4/28/2015,"LG G3 and even download for offline viewing, the videos are so choppy they are un-watchable.",1
4/28/2015,Great app,5
4/28/2015,"Picked 2 random courses, both won't play",1
4/28/2015,It keeps crashing on me when i scroll down from the recent tab on my samsung tab2,2
4/28/2015,"The app crashes frequently on me.  Some of the courses have a very annoying stutter in the audio track. And you cannot tell it to save the course material to your SD card. Many of the courses are great, too bad the mobile app for Android is so bad.",1
4/28/2015,"While Pluralsight is amazing but this application not working properly, some time not responding, checking the permission take a very long time, some time telling  yoy have no access on a course while my subscription is valid... please fix it",1
4/27/2015,App crashes,5
4/27/2015,"Does anyone at Pluralsight actually read these comments?                                           Update: Still, Video / Audio is choppy when viewing in landscape mode on my brand new Samsung Note Edge! Shouldn't be choppy at all! It's not my Internet because I currently get 8+ Mbps download speed! Works fine in portrait mode. Also, my home WiFi is 100mbps+ with comcast so I know it's not my Internet speed!",1
4/27/2015,Very convenient to use,5
4/27/2015,Better,5
4/26/2015,"As many people have said, it's good but would be better if it was synced to the desktop account (i.e. play lists etc).",3
4/25/2015,Excellent courses but had to change review since downloading courses takes forever. I have to keep the app open and have to pause and resume the download or else it just stops downloading. Sometimes it takes days to download a course as I cannot monitor the download untill it's complete. Would be nice if downloads could continue in the background. Having issues with downloaded just dissappears and download starts again. This ised up all my bandwith for a mont in just one course :(,2
4/25/2015,...and won't get past that stage. I have an active Annual Plus account! And the iPad app is only marginally better!,1
4/25/2015,"I really can't believe there's no history from the Web browser sessions. No bookmarks, nothing.",2
4/25/2015,Patchy sound and less than smooth video playback when running in landscape mode.,3
4/24/2015,Don't bother,1
4/24/2015,What more can I say than what has been said by many others? It needs to sync with them site. Would be good to get some of them site functionality in here too. I like being able to download content. That's awesome.,3
4/24/2015,When trying to play at 2.0 rate and full screen on my nexus 5 the player struggles and the audio pops like crazy. Virtually unwatchable. The middle I am watching is downloaded so it's not network. Please fix that so I can use my phone to watch lessons.,4
4/24/2015,Good content but app needs To add chromecast support,3
4/23/2015,"Really like the offline mode when flying. Would like to have chromecast support, but in the meantime I use screen casting.",4
4/23/2015,This app works wonderfully but it lacks some of the most necessary features which would make it truly useful. If you can bookmark items in the web console then you should be able to see those bookmarks on your mobile device. Same goes for Playlists. This would allow users to resume where they left off. Additionally I should be able to browse and bookmark on the go. The &quot;Recent&quot; section does not show what I have viewed on my laptop. If these features were added it would enhance the usability of this product many times over. I would be remiss if I did not state how wonderful the videos look and how well the course navigation works in the app.,2
4/23/2015,Need more improvements but overall is good,5
4/22/2015,Landscape mode doesn't support fast play. I have to use portrait but then the video is to small. Doesn't show my courses. Search bar displays too little.,2
4/21/2015,Audio in landscape. No sync of history. Shame on pluralsight for not addressing these issues for months,1
4/21/2015,"If there is a trick to playing offline content, then I do not see it.  I have cached a couple courses... I click on one and it looks like it wants to play.  I click the play button and it returns me to the menu of cached courses. Also, it does not seem to have Chromecast support.  Very lame app... I might downgrade my subscription in a bit...",1
4/20/2015,Won't even start without crashing.  Galaxy note 3.  Android version 5.0,1
4/19/2015,"So far didn't face any issues, very responsive",5
4/18/2015,"The pluralsight  app overrides the system settings to enable screen rotation, even when it has disabled system wide.",1
4/18/2015,"Everything sounds very choppy even in 1x. It does not buffer ahead. I have no problems playing netflix, amazon movies, etc. This is not a bandwidth issue.",1
4/18/2015,Excellent app.. Specially love the offline feature.,5
4/17/2015,"EDIT**** They fixed the sound issue, well at least i don't have it anymore so kquite usefull app *******                The sound shutters so much it's impossible to watch. On a Nexus 5. Made by a company that is supposed to teach you how to code for mobile devices...",4
4/17/2015,Got another year subscription,5
4/16/2015,But eats the battery at a crazy rate..,3
4/16/2015,All I wanted was to log in and watch a vid from my list of bookmarks! No can do. Uninstalled immediately.,1
4/16/2015,Often the app just hangs on playback. I have fast WiFi. Sometimes killing the app helps.,1
4/15/2015,This app makes it easy to access content from the website. Very nice.,5
4/15/2015,"Chromecasting is a must have, please add it. Bookmarks and history is missing as well",3
4/13/2015,Great app.,4
4/12/2015,Loved it alot,5
4/12/2015,"Worked well enough for downloading and playing the content for a few courses. Then, everything just stopped working for both online and offline content.  Player could be better when it does work (devs - take note from other online video content delivery provider apps).",2
4/11/2015,This company and app have been a great boon to my growth as a developer. Thanks Pluralsight!,5
4/10/2015,ADD AN OPTION TO LOCK THE SCREEN. I have accidentally hit different lessons more times than I can remember which cancels your current lesson without any method back to your previous location.,1
4/10/2015,If I wanted to continue my course in mobile app it won't show the course I was watching on the mobile. It looks so outdated,2
4/10/2015,Checking permission even I had a annual plus account,1
4/9/2015,The UI needs a refresh to standards and there's some bugs lingering. Reopening the app shows a toast &quot;course not found&quot; and I have to search for what I was doing again.,3
4/9/2015,"More often than not, the video doesn't play, I just get the loading icon, but nothing loads. It's very inconsistent. No options to bookmark items I've searched and want to revisit. Recent items doesn't seem function properly either.",2
4/9/2015,Huge database,4
4/9/2015,I have got a problem with this app. If I wanted to watch the lessons in landscape mode my devices start to lag. If I put my phone or tab on portrait mode there is no problem at all. Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 & Motorola Moto G,2
4/9/2015,"Would have given 5 stars,but it gets all choppy and screws up when you go to full screen.",4
4/8/2015,No Chromecast,2
4/8/2015,Today it is stuck in a &quot;checking permissions&quot; loop. I can't upskill on my commute despite having my company buy their subscription because of their poor QC on app releases.,1
4/7/2015,"Great content, impressively poor app performance, especially considering content is already downloaded to the phone. Audio skips every 2-3 seconds. Gives the training a bad face.",2
4/6/2015,"When I download an app it seems to work the first time or so, but that course becomes inaccessible for some mysterious reason and I end up downloading it all over again. It defeats the purpose of offline browsing and also is frustrating.",2
4/6/2015,But how do you cancel downloads of modules? I can only seem to pause them on the app.,4
4/5/2015,Keep displaying this message from last 3 months and unable to view any tutorial,3
4/5/2015,"For a company providing development training it's impossible to think why they think this app is good enough. Poor controls, the faster audio skips sections. Honestly it's just rubbish.",1
4/4/2015,"Even though you are required to login it does give you access to your play queue, neither does it synchronise any viewing data for partially completed courses viewed elsewhere e.g. desktop.",3
4/3/2015,"The courses are good, love the site, hate having to remember where I left off or what courses I wanted to watch next.",3
4/2/2015,I like downloading courses for offline viewing but it's very slow over wifi. Playback also can be choppy.,4
4/2/2015,"No lesson syncs, has less functionality than the website itself, and often lessons have audio&video sync problems even on a samsung g s5. Lesson contents are mostly good.",3
4/2/2015,Solid app.,5
4/2/2015,"This app is pretty good, but I noticed it skips at higher speeds (I.e. 2x) in Android 5.0 when viewing landscape. Seems fine in portrait.",3
4/1/2015,Choppy audio in full screen on HTC One M7 when speeding up from 1.25 and above.,1
4/1/2015,Love the content.,5
3/31/2015,It's a great website. You can make it better if you have a less buggy app..,1
3/30/2015,"Excellent app, terrific service.  The subscription is well worth it.",5
3/30/2015,"Choppy audio in landscape on my phone, makes the app pretty much unusable when I'm on the go. Audio is fine with portrait but frustrating that I can't flip for a bigger view. All other video apps run fine; Netflix streams perfectly in landscape.",2
3/30/2015,This app would be excellent... If the audio worked. Unfortunately when viewing videos in landscape mode the audio stutters making the videos unwatchable. Shame as the features are all there but this one problem makes the app unusable.,1
3/30/2015,Thanks for the contributions !,5
3/30/2015,I get some lag on horizontal view and sometimes the app crashes. It's okay for the most part.,3
3/29/2015,Didn't know they had an app and it already does everything you need,5
3/28/2015,"Overall, a good application to view from mobile devices. I would still prefer to view the courses from a laptop or desktop. One minor issue I noticed is that when watching from landscape view and switching to the next topic, the pause control appears right in the middle of the course content and does not disappear unless you rotate your device into portrait view and then back to landscape.",4
3/28/2015,"Great app, but does fail randomly",4
3/28/2015,Teacher in ur pocket :-):-):-),4
3/27/2015,"This is a great app, but there is an issue with full screen and module transition. When it transitions from section to section the screen overlay comes back up. This should be fixed. Otherwise great app.",4
3/27/2015,"Simple to use, very good App.",5
3/27/2015,Simply doesn't work.,1
3/27/2015,Nice app.,5
3/25/2015,Not intuitive and does not update my progress across devices .  Pulling out my laptop to watch,1
3/25/2015,App won't let me login.,1
3/25/2015,Don't like the app.,2
3/25/2015,The video is too choppy on the android version.,2
3/24/2015,Overall I'm satisfied with the app and the service. I get 2 issues.  Some crashes when I try to change videos in the middle of playback. Also sometimes the play/pause button remains hovering over the video while the video is playing.   Android 4.4.4,4
3/24/2015,"Not able to open it , crashing everytime",1
3/24/2015,OK to use,3
3/23/2015,The audio hiccups on every video. I would also like access to my saved courses from the site. I will stock to the browser I guess.,1
3/23/2015,"I can log in without issue on any computer, but the app refuses my credentials. I would love to view this training on the go since I have an hour commute each way, but I can't. Back to Udemy it is.",1
3/22/2015,"2015-03-22 - PluralSight, please contact me. I have a laundry list for you, and I'd rather help you isolate the issues than give the app a bad review.",1
3/22/2015,Tech app,5
3/21/2015,Where is the full screen button? Where is the Chromecast button?,1
3/21/2015,"Without syncing history and favorites, this app isn't very helpful. I wasn't expecting the app to have all the features of the website, but these two are really the only ones I need.",2
3/20/2015,I would do five star however on my LG G3 the app is really choppy and playing video back in a horizontal view. I can only watch video from my phone in a vertical view so the print gets really small at times. Other than that the app is great. so when I watch video with small print I have to go back to my computer and watch again.,3
3/20/2015,"Sorry but the most important feature of this app is to learn by watching and listening to training videos. You can't do that if the sound is not clear, it downloads the videos for offline playing not the network so why is it stuttering my phone is new and high end so that leaves the app.",1
3/19/2015,Audio stutter. Video not always synced with audio. Ignores screen rotation setting. Needs favorites of courses interested in viewing. Displaying course paths would be major plus.,3
3/19/2015,- 4 stars for not even allowing me to log in. I can login fine on any computer ie laptop or desktop but the app keeps giving me an error.,1
3/19/2015,"I like the interface and speed. Would be great if we have learning paths are also integrated in the app, like you have them in desktop portal!",3
3/18/2015,"Pluralsight itself as a service is second to none. The android app works satisfactorily, albeit is behind current useful site features (bookmarks, playlists), also chromecast support would be nifty.",4
3/17/2015,This site is the best for aspiring developers such as myself.,5
3/16/2015,Trying to watch a module leads to a black checking permissions screen.,1
3/16/2015,"Not as good as the website, but nice",4
3/16/2015,It's quite okay but even though I have downloaded some courses for offline viewing the app suddenly says they're only 17% downloaded. Very frustrating when you're on a slow live abroad. The lack of progress sync is also annoying. I don't know about the Chromecast support in this version but it appeared in PS for iOS before Android. Weird...,3
3/15/2015,"After first day: Several unexpected crashes during playback. Downloads are astronomically large(over 500mb for one module with 7 videos) and take forever to download, then they won't even play smoothly. The videos jump and skip a lot. It should sync with my online account. Meanwhile, I am supposed to be learning from them how to make apps, but I wonder if their devs should be the ones taking these courses.",1
3/14/2015,The best developer content out there.,5
3/14/2015,Need some work,4
3/14/2015,What's the point in having offline content if you can't play it.,1
3/13/2015,"No bookmarks, no playlist, playback is choppy at any speed above 1.0. Downloading module for offline does not work, it just sits at 0 percent.",2
3/13/2015,"Pluralsight has plenty of good content, but this app is terrible. Offline feature fails most of the time, making my premium signature almost useless. No bookmarks. No playlists. Syncing with web progress is poor. Needs a lot of improvements.",1
3/13/2015,"Can't compare to the previous version since this is the first I've tried. But compared to the windows one which perhaps lacks in features, the features here is very unstable. I can't even change chapter or it will throw you to the main",1
3/12/2015,"Sometimes the videos are choppy in landscape view.  It's not the network as the videos have been pre downloaded over WiFi.  If landscape is choppy, you can still watch in portrait mode.  4/5 stars",4
3/11/2015,Best source of the latest development training courses,4
3/11/2015,"Bookmarked courses must be a priority, instead of digging the context menu. Also there should be a play and continue were the course was left off.",3
3/10/2015,What a disappointment form the website version. Poor UI and downloads never actually do!,2
3/10/2015,The service has a lot of great tutorials.  The app makes it convenient to store some to watch offline. Recently fixed a lot of performance issues.,5
3/10/2015,"The pluralsight content is amazing, but this app is barely usable. The app frequently crashes, and pauses frequently to buffer audio/video. I prefer to watch videos on the way to and from work, which is difficult when the app crashes every 2 to 3 minutes.",2
3/10/2015,Thank you guys! Great job on patching the app for lollipop ;) Wish the web-ui would have retained non-tag based course layout too :),5
3/9/2015,Is anyone reading the feedback here? Audio even in offline mode is horrible!,1
3/9/2015,Considering that using this is a premium feature the offline capabilities are poor at best.  After watching a course offline I find that my status on the website has not been updated. After watching a section of a course the overlay refuses to disappear which leaves a pause button right in the middle of the video.  Considering that the content is so good the app is so bad.  I'm using my Nexus 7.,2
3/8/2015,"Sometimes runs fine, but most of the time audio is glitchy, even when I make sure nothing else is running",3
3/8/2015,"As each video starts, the progress bar and play/pause button are shown but are never removed from the screen. Contrast this with their appearance and fade-removal upon touching the screen. Changing orientation removes them. I realise that there's limited competition  with other apps to serve your content; nevertheless, it would be nice to have the bugs removed. Thanks.",2
3/7/2015,"I have a limited subscription available through MSDN. Using this app, as well as the Pluralsight website, there is no separate list or way to filter to show just the videos available to me. Also what I have watched here does not reflect in progress I've made through other devices. Would be nice to have progress sync'd across devices. Great courses (some of the best there is) but not showcased well in either the Android app or even the website.",2
3/6/2015,Sucks,5
3/6/2015,Pluralsight gives you training opportunities you would typically wouldn't have been able to afford.,5
3/5/2015,Can't get past checking permissions...,1
3/5/2015,"I've been trying to watch some of the videos with my galaxy note 3, and with one exception, every video I have tried has had audio problems, even with the course fully downloaded for offline viewing.  The same course on the desktop is just fine.  I have an ipad too (and some other android devices I could try), but I've not yet tested playback with it.  The very first file I ever played was good... but every other one has been unbearable.  The course content itself is wonderful...the review only reflects the player software.",2
3/5/2015,The app seems to be stuck loading the videos but nothing happens. Galaxy Note 4.,1
3/4/2015,So far no crashes on my Galaxy S5 or Tab4. Of course not as good as the website but okay for the commute to and from work.,4
3/3/2015,"Update: After the latest update, the app behaves as bad, if not worse, than before....    The only reason for me to install this app was for the offline feature, and it doesn't work for me. Also, the audio is constantly interrupted. If I access the site via the browser, the audio is fine, so I guess is the app. This review is for the app, the site content is 5 stars",1
3/3/2015,Pluralsight teachers do a great job and provide excellent step by step training on so many subjects.  The app makes it so easy to navigate.  Its like having a complete training facility in my pocket.,5
3/2/2015,Audio stutters when screen is rotated to Landscape on some videos.,2
3/2/2015,"I think the app needs to be updated because all I'm getting is clocking and doesn't load my previous saved courses. Connection to the web server appears to be faulty. I'm logged in fine, however when I go to play videos it keeps loading as if it needs to check account credentials, any of the new videos I try to watch still have the do not enter logo sign...?",2
3/2/2015,I really like the service but the app keeps crashing. I ended up using the mobile website which turned out to be much more reliable...,2
3/2/2015,Works great,5
3/2/2015,"The app just needs a few tweaks for a five star review, for me: 1. a button on the video player to switch to full-screen. 2. Notification area playback controls. 3. Last but not least, I like to listen only sometimes. Allow me to turn the screen off and otherwise play courses in the background.",4
3/1/2015,"Installed today for the first time. Its not working. Search is not working. I have login, and was able to login. But all I can see is blank screen. Trying on WiFi so no issues with connectivity.",1
3/1/2015,3/1/15 still terrible.,1
2/28/2015,Very helpful in understanding complex subjects!,4
2/28/2015,Download for offline is very slow.,3
2/27/2015,"Does exactly what it should. Plus, like the iOS version, allows courses to be saved. Nice. Some other users report problems, but on the Nexus 6,at least, it does exactly what I hoped it would.",5
2/27/2015,"Lots of problems with this app.  I have to restart my tablet often to get it to work.  The screen does not go into power saving if you forget to close out the app, so the battery will out in just a couple hours. The website is way better.",2
2/27/2015,Every video I have tried has stuttering audio in landscape mode online and offline. This a known problem they have yet to correct. This app is unuseable garbage. Follow their advice from their support forum and just use your browser. Pretty bad that a company that claims to teach programming publishes a broken app they will not or cannot fix.,1
2/26/2015,"It's an okay app with great content, but it needs Chromecast support!",2
2/26/2015,OK but horrible flaw in that history is not synced with website.,4
2/26/2015,"Love PS content and never have problems with streaming through the website at home.  This app was working well until the last update (even with severely stripped down functionality).  Now, video hangs every few minutes, kicks out to main screen, and doesn't track progress when I restart.  Very frustrating since my client blocks the website on their network, and mobile app is my only access to PS.",3
2/26/2015,"Only minor connectivity issues,  not sure if it is my provider or the service.",5
2/25/2015,Was all excited Android finally received an update and then I actually launched it. No Chromecast support and the audio stuttering still exists on higher speed playback modes. Better but still pretty worthless.,2
2/25/2015,"Yeah, I have to second that. Why no Chromecast for Android?",2
2/25/2015,"Pluralsight is great but this app is a real letdown, it does not have the essential features found on the website.",1
2/25/2015,I use this in the car with offline resources to do training on my long commute. The resources are excellent and this access is just what I need.,5
2/24/2015,"The app has the basics you would want in an offline viewer. Navigation options could be more visually pronounced. My eyes do not naturally read the gray text quickly. I like the module view. Lastly, the 30-module limit isn't bad.",5
2/24/2015,"Very good content, apps is not bad but can improve",4
2/24/2015,"The audio stuttering in landscape mode is awful; since I use my phone to watch videos during a commute, trying to view code in the portrait mode viewer is all but impossible.  It's been like this for at least 18 months, possibly longer - can't believe it's still not fixed.",3
2/24/2015,.,4
2/24/2015,"I've tried many &quot;CBT&quot; packages and providers, and Pluralsight is the best fit for me.",5
2/24/2015,"Streaming is not smooth,  the ui looks stale and the app is not intuitive. The content is nice though",2
2/23/2015,There have been many topics which I have needed to gain knowledge fast but also don't have the time to learn the subject in a classroom setting.  This brings the classroom to you and can even double as an &quot;audio class&quot; much like audio books.  Great app and great service!,5
2/23/2015,"This app has definately come in useful. It's being used on a Galaxy Note 3. You would think that  device this size is sufficient for viewing these videos however depending on the video content, it still isn't quite large enough. That's were having the ability to go fullscreen with this app becomes useful. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow you to go fullscreen. What a bumper. If the developers update this with full screen option, I may just be willing give it a 5 star rating. Without fullscreen, 3 stars it is.",3
2/22/2015,"This is a real shame.  The app itself is actually very nice but a lot of the courses (not all) have sound stutter/lag, which completely destroys the user experience.  I think this is unacceptable since this isn't a free service. I have a hard time believing that no one in their development department is able to test their app on a Nexus 7 device or able to at least look into the issue and make it a top priority bug to be fixed. If not for the sound issue, I would have given it 5 stars.",2
2/22/2015,Audio defiantly an issue. History is not synched across devices.. What the heck.. How many days these guys Will take to resolve audio quality issue.,1
2/22/2015,"Please fix the app. For a company whose main focus is teaching IT, you would think someone could update the app. Videos no longer load and offline viewing will not download for my plus account. I am wasting my money.",1
2/22/2015,Wouldn't work until I redid my tabbie...now works fine biz,5
2/22/2015,Lags and stutters in landscape mode...ironic.,2
2/21/2015,"All sorts of, technical and non technical, quality trainings.",5
2/21/2015,Experienced Instructors and Wide range of topics.. Cannot ask for more than this..,5
2/21/2015,App Stuck at checking license..doesn't play any course video. I have annual membership. Still facing this issue.,1
2/21/2015,This is a great application so far.,5
2/21/2015,This is simply not good enough for paying customers. Such a shame since the content is awesome on the desktop browser..,1
2/21/2015,Good content,4
2/20/2015,Superb keep it done,5
2/19/2015,"Pluralsight is great but this app really needs chromecast support.   With all the money they've raised, it doesn't make sense that this app is lagging behind so much.",3
2/18/2015,"Content is fantastic, but most of the videos stutter like crazy. I'm using a Galaxy Tab S 10, with 100mbps internet connection. I recommend just using Chrome and the Pluralsight website instead of the app. Edit: stuttering doesn't seem as common anymore, but still present in some videos.",3
2/18/2015,Working great!!!,4
2/18/2015,Application works great,4
2/18/2015,"I had to knock a star off as you can't move it's storage to an sdcard on the phone.  Otherwise, two thumbs up!",4
2/18/2015,Good UI but there are two huge bugs. 1. The videos stutter quite w bit on my phone and tablet. 2. My progress in classes is  not in sync between web and app. Finnally.. a key feature is missing from the app: the app should know the classes i started on the web. Sad that such great content isnt accessible via mobile.,1
2/18/2015,"This is all I get.  For every course, checking permissions.  I have no problems with the web site, but I have had no luck with getting the android app to work..  Nexus 5 - lollipop 5.0.1",1
2/18/2015,"Can you really trust software engineering content from a company that can't write a usable app to deliver their content? From other comments, it's clear the horrible audio problems I experience have been present for at least months. It seems like the company is too focused on acquiring other technical content companies to pay attention to their existing business and customers. It frustrates me that I spent a lot of extra money on the premium mobile subscription for nothing.",2
2/17/2015,Someway to sync your web settings,3
2/17/2015,"That's all it seems to be good for, can't seem to watch any training",2
2/16/2015,Fantastic app and content,5
2/16/2015,"No there is no excuse not to take IT certs!  Works perfectly, no buffering.  I'm glad to have the option to save the chapter locally also.  Perfect for people on the go!  Very impressed!",5
2/16/2015,"Audio stutters in landscape mode making it almost useless .  It's ok in portrait mode but the video is too small now to Be of use. Running this one HTC one,  a new flagship phone but even so the app is very laggy.  Takes 1-2 seconds to respond to a touch.",2
2/16/2015,The content is great but it does stutter in landscape.,3
2/16/2015,"Didn't play anything on my tab. Just shows table of content. No sync of personal data either. Pluralsight Web is great, android app junk.",2
2/16/2015,Love that this is available and that you can download courses to watch offline,5
2/15/2015,"Audio skips in landscape... Major annoyance.  Otherwise, I'd have no problems with the app. Love the content.",3
2/15/2015,Smooth & simple. Able to learn Everything Development & Technology wise! Soo grateful for Pluralsight & the Mobile app!,5
2/15/2015,Excellent app however on my Samsung Galaxy Note every video freezes when it hits about 85%and I have to restart the video to finish watching. Not a deal breaker for me but it is is perplexing.,5
2/15/2015,It is over all a good app. Need to be more smooth and professional. Also the video size is rendered as small on 7' tablet. Provide an option to resize the screen or provide a full screen view.,3
2/14/2015,Completion/Progress is not sync'd back to website and intermittent &quot;checking permissions&quot; issues,1
2/13/2015,I did not like the playback as a lot of reviewers have commented. The audio is indeed broken. But it is not so bad on a mobile as compared to my laptop running windows 7. Maybe the smaller screen was better suited for the stream feed. But I must say the content is really good. I hope the player will be updated soon. Thank you for an excellent learning source.,4
2/13/2015,I download the videos to my device (LG G3). If I watch the video in portrait mode the video is so small I can't see it.  If I watch it in Landscape mode the audio stutters so much that I can't bear to watch it.  Please fix this!,1
2/12/2015,"This is a pretty good app at what it does. I removed one star from the review because the app ASKED me to rate it, I don't like it when it apps do that.",3
2/12/2015,"History does not appear to include courses taken on Web version,  and no way to view bookmarked or my playlist.",2
2/12/2015,Still a little buggy but great content,4
2/11/2015,Overall a good app however the skipping of audio in landscape mode is quite an irritation. Once that's resolved I think it will be great,3
2/11/2015,"I love Pluralsight, but the audio stuttering problem makes watching videos on the Android app really unpleasant. Please fix! :)",3
2/11/2015,All videos hang on checking permissions.,1
2/11/2015,"The app appears to work week, but it's no super shiny or anything. I would like to see better handling of bookmarks, history, and playlists,  but it gets the job done. The site content is what really sells this platform, but if you grabbed the app, you probably already know that part",4
2/10/2015,"Whilst some of the pluralsight content is good, this app really isn't. Can't download any course for offline viewing, it just sits there on zero percent. Can't stream any course, it just says it's checking permissions. Really poor effort.",1
2/9/2015,"Haven't noticed any audio stuttering. Great for bed, couch, train. Keeps it simple.",4
2/9/2015,"Update: Since my last review, the app wont even play videos. They wont load and when they start to, they get stuck on &quot;checking permissions&quot;. Original review: This review is strictly about the app - no negative comments on the content at this point. Not enough features. You can't do even half of what you can using the site. Great content but the app is lacking in most departments. What is there works fine, but there isn't much there.",1
2/9/2015,I haven't encountered any audio issues as some described so maybe thats been fixed? Gotta love this app! Saves me a lot of time training my teams and plenty to learn from it too! Offline mobile access is the cherry on top. Perfect.,5
2/9/2015,Crashes on launch htc1,1
2/8/2015,No issues with playing the training videos but some options from full fledged site is missing.I would like to see my dashboard and play list in the app and a facility to create personal playlists would be nice.,3
2/8/2015,Just perfect,5
2/6/2015,Very useful,5
2/6/2015,"I used to watch most of the courses on the train, but since the lollipop update, this app is totally unusable. Videos buffer and never play, trying to download offline content sits on 0% for ever. I'd maybe understand if it was free, but with an annual subscription of over £200 I really expected better. I shan't be renewing unfortunately.",1
2/5/2015,"Love pluralsight, but this app is awful. Nothing will play or download no matter what I do;  it's stuck infinitely on &quot;checking permissions.&quot;",1
2/5/2015,Please fix this!,3
2/5/2015,The constant sound glitches become very annoying. Please work to improve sound buffering. Thx,3
2/5/2015,Works great when you have good cell signal if you using your cell phone it's been it's been solid I do see that sometimes the bookmarks out of sync and I'm not sure if that was the way the application is closed or easy fix then code,4
2/4/2015,The offline functionality is not usable as it causes the audio to stutter. You can't lock the screen or the video will stop playing. Sometimes I'm just trying to listen to the audio so this is pretty annoying. Video frequently &quot;locks up&quot; so I have to move to a different portion of the video to get playback to resume. I've also had to reinstall once when the application got into some kind of state where it wouldn't play anything. Overall pretty terrible considering the price of the subscription.,2
2/4/2015,Even when downloading the courses the audio stutters and some won't even play. Downloaded ones suddenly disappeared.  Reloaded them and all won't play.  Chrome browser on tablet works great but obviously cannot watch offline,1
2/3/2015,Content really useful and good to have app but sometimes get stuck buffering and need to close app to be able to view content again,4
2/3/2015,Completely useless due to the apps audio problem.,1
2/3/2015,"It only seems to happen in landscape mode,  but the content is great!",4
2/3/2015,Would be great if you could use it full screen on tablet. As soon as full screen is selected the audio stutter in unbearable.  Please fix,1
2/2/2015,The training material is excellent and they have a huge range of training material. I make extensive use of the material. Definitely recommend. The app works flawlessly. Although it could do with DLNA or Chromecast support.,5
2/1/2015,I love the service. I recommend it to everyone I know. The way to navigate around though I hate. Wish it was setup more like digital tutors.,4
1/31/2015,Great learning source,5
1/31/2015,"All the video tutorials so far are very interesting to me, but this app is not the best one. Fullsceen video does not work. And the transcripts could be a little bit more structured. Not the way they are!",3
1/29/2015,Good,3
1/28/2015,Not the best app. Downloads don't always download easy enough. It's a clunky app functional wise.,2
1/28/2015,I'll come back if there is an update with audio fix,2
1/28/2015,Intuitively UI & rich and new content,5
1/28/2015,I love learning like this.,5
1/28/2015,"With poor quality of audio, can't understand how this can be useful",2
1/27/2015,It doesnt have a sound. Im using kitkat.,1
1/27/2015,Working fine now on lollipop.,5
1/27/2015,Like it!,5
1/27/2015,Add bookmarks list from my account,4
1/26/2015,Excellent,5
1/26/2015,"Awesome...great for learning on the go, course downloads are very convenient",5
1/25/2015,Thanks!,5
1/25/2015,"Pluralsight's course content is great but this app does not do it justice. There is no sign of bookmarking here, either viewing your existing bookmarks or bookmarking courses. It appears the recently watched is per-device so it's not synced with viewing I did elsewhere.",2
1/25/2015,Loved Pluralsiggt for years now.,5
1/25/2015,"Glad to have Android 5 support, but seems to not be working again.",3
1/24/2015,"Good app... just needs a little more work. Wish the course navigation was more structured. Currently it's in one alphabetical lump sum. Not sure if I can access bonus material from this as I have tried but am unable. Offline mode can be cumbersome but work's well. Audio can stutter, especially when the playing speed is increased.",3
1/24/2015,"It's kind of funny they teach tech and programming yet the app is terrible and lacking features, maybe they should watch some of their own courses..",1
1/24/2015,"App has many issues..1. Automatic rotate is alwaya on even if I dont want to autorotate , why ?    2. Initial load time too high... 3. Video does not load easily and not that friendly app.",2
1/24/2015,Great app. Didn't experience any stuttering with the audio unlike other reviewers. Loved the fact that I can download modules to view later.,5
1/23/2015,"Constantly loosing connection, spinning my time away.  Had authentication issues as well.  Audio chop is bearable, needs to be addressed.  Content is refresh often, great selection.  Previous versions of app worked far better.",3
1/22/2015,Can't even start video. Infinite permissions check.,1
1/22/2015,"This app allows me to watch everywhere I go, and then some. Wish I could download more, and I wish there was career paths for course sets available similar to the full site.",4
1/21/2015,Great,5
1/21/2015,This app is better than the website to be honest. I hope many others decide to use it.,5
1/21/2015,Only wish it would let me download more videos for offline viewing.,5
1/20/2015,"You can't access your play lists. Also, no chromecast support.",1
1/20/2015,Good one,4
1/20/2015,Love it!,5
1/19/2015,"But audio is jittery, and half the time I can't get past &quot;checking permissions...&quot;",2
1/19/2015,"Loading video & audio sucks, out of 30min I spend 15 in waiting and frustration and after that u loose your mood to learn. Atleast next 2 videos should be cached.",1
1/19/2015,But videos are little slow and sometimes they stuck.,4
1/19/2015,Not really usable.,2
1/19/2015,"I have used this app for about 3 months.  The content is great, but the app has some problems.  I kept getting a &quot;checking permissions&quot; problem which didn't allow me to view any video.  I found somewhere on the web where you need to clear your cache data for the app and things will work again. That solved the security problem.  The next problem is the audio stutters in landscape mode.  If you click on the search field to bring up the keyboard, the stuttering goes away in landscape mode or if you switch to portrait mode, the stuttering goes away. The problem is that the videos are much smaller when you do this.",3
1/19/2015,Get some brain food during commute. Continuous play keeps it hands free.,4
1/18/2015,"This does a good enough job for playing the trainings, but poor support for casting.",3
1/17/2015,Please fix the audio,1
1/17/2015,Audio stutters CONSTANTLY in landscape mode. Unacceptable.,3
1/17/2015,"And that's really the whole point for me. Great content. Works fine on iOS devices. App nearly unusable on my N5, lollipop 5.0.1.",2
1/17/2015,No audio!!,1
1/15/2015,Works as intended. Missing some features like offline viewing. At times it also does not do a great job of tracking progress from app to site and vice versa.,4
1/14/2015,Ok when it works.,3
1/14/2015,App does not sync with web account do you cannot pick up where you left off.,2
1/13/2015,There is a lag on viewing full screen videos which causes the voices to cut out every second.,1
1/12/2015,Sound is getting stuck... Useless application...,1
1/12/2015,Basic feature is not right,1
1/11/2015,Excellent features and one thing is missing speed control for slow would have presence its good,4
1/11/2015,U get a 5 when Chromecast support is available. IOS before android is ridiculous.,4
1/11/2015,The audio video content is very high quality...,5
1/10/2015,Audio issues make it difficult to learn. If you are going to charge for this content your mobile apps need to work well.,1
1/9/2015,"Works great in portrait mode, unusable in landscape.",2
1/9/2015,"The content is top notch, but the app crashes and hangs a lot on the Note 3.",3
1/9/2015,"Useful app, great to have off-line syncing. I would give 4 stars if it had Chromecast support.",3
1/9/2015,"It seems that the last big update was a good few years ago and they only fixes that have been released are for issues that make the app completely unusable. Issues that are annoying are not fixed. Search crashes on Android 5, audio stutters and downloading content hangs sometimes and you need to delete it and redownload. For a company that has it main focus on developing this is a disgrace (app on IOS is not much bettet)",2
1/7/2015,Reasonable features but downloaded content has a habit of disappearing and having to be downloaded again and again.,2
1/7/2015,Landcape mode. Fix it,1
1/7/2015,Love the app.  Love pluralsight :),5
1/7/2015,Very nice app,5
1/6/2015,"The audio stutters, particularly in landscape. Shame, because the content is great :/",2
1/5/2015,"I want to love this app, I love the content but when I turn my phone to landscape, the audio quickly begins to stutter.  I can use the app in portrait mode but the video is tiny then.  My phone is more than capable of handling the video -- it is a OnePlus One, lots of RAM and processor available.  I have no issues with Netflix or YouTube.",2
1/5/2015,Just doesn't  work.,1
1/4/2015,"I upgraded to a Plus account for offline viewing, only to find that it doesn't work.  Don't make the same mistake!",1
1/4/2015,"I am a Plus subscriber and am disappointed with this app.   With an internet connection I have no problems, however I mostly want to use it on a commute to work where I have no internet connection.  Using a Nexus 4 the app happily downloads offline content but almost at random it will suddenly delete the content and I'll be left staring at a loading spinner.  **edit** this turned out to be a lack of space on my phone, the phone reclaims the space when it gets low",4
1/4/2015,"The app is missing all the basic features of the website, coming from a tech company this kind of app is extremely disappointing. You can not view your history or your bookmarked courses and there is no easy navigation other than the list of categories...",1
1/3/2015,Please disable the automatic rotation,1
1/2/2015,"App works well but Chromecast support is not available on Android. Also, current position in a course seems to be maintained locally rather than in the cloud making it inconvenient to switch devices.",3
1/2/2015,"App stopped downloading the modules, so uninstalled the app reinstalled it. And now the app is stuck at downloading catalog. Nothing happens after that. I hope they provide an update soon.",1
1/1/2015,Annoying broken audio even if the course is downloaded for offline use.,1
1/1/2015,"Not sync with web history. why? No playlist, no bookmarks... web portal much more convenient!",1
12/31/2014,"I've got months of train-commute material to study before even scratching the surface of everything I want to learn. Thank you, Pluralsight, for the offline mode.",5
12/31/2014,"Basics work great, but it would be nice if I could see my bookmarks and playlist in the app.",4
12/30/2014,"Perfect service for developers wanting to learn a wide range of skills. I've never  felt more comfortable as a developer. I've learned events and delegates in C#, learned video game development in Unity, gained rudimentary 3D modeling skills in Blender, learned Html5 and Javascript. I am having an absolute blast with this service. Thanks, keep up the great work!",5
12/29/2014,Amazing,5
12/28/2014,Works Perfect!,4
12/27/2014,"Stutters on full screen playback, audio often garbled at start of a new section, although my tablet has no problem with hd movies! Lollipop fix was a while coming even though it was noted that pluralsight didn't work with the preview in July! Seemed to be working after latest update but now crashes on startup and reinstall hangs on catalog. Basically pretty pathetic. Pluralsight should do a course on writing robust apps and then make the developers of this player watch it.",1
12/26/2014,Where are captions?,2
12/23/2014,"Good content, not fan of the app",3
12/22/2014,"The app works well but there are a couple of things that could be done to take the mobile experience from ok to great. There needs to be some way of bookmarking important moments, being on mobile switching out to a note taking app is possible but tedious and breaks the flow. Being able to bookmark and maybe even annotate would be awesome. It would be great to be able to zoom in on the videos,my S5 screen is just a bit to small for a lot of the code samples to be readable.  Overall a good start.",4
12/22/2014,"I wanted to love this, but the audio stutters constantly making it painful to listen to.",1
12/22/2014,"Great for mobile, however, they need a way to blank the screen while listening since it eats the battery much faster with an enabled screen. landscape mode is a bit choppy with the sound.",4
12/22/2014,"Some videos fine, many others have skipping/chuggy audio. According to 3C Toolbox this app used 75%+ of my Tab Pro RAM -- with other system services running this put it at 100% RAM used",3
12/21/2014,"I've  been using PS products for quite some time now with different subscriptions and all works fine and I often come back to different topics videos. Recently,  I've started using Tab 3 and the sound quality is just terrible (hence 2 star drop).  It's just impossible to listen to videos which are constantly stopping. Any other device including Note II phone are fine,  tablet not so much.  Other than that brilliant learning platform. ***After recent update works like magic,  nice job on bigger mobile devices,  Pluralsight :)",5
12/20/2014,App works well on all my Galaxy devices. However it would be great if Chromecast support is availble.,5
12/19/2014,"This should be rated higher but, for some reason that defies logic, they rolled out Chromecast support on iOS fifty years ago and still haven't rolled it out on Android.",3
12/19/2014,I don't get beyond checking permissions since I have updated to Lollypop. The app is useless now. Hope you will fix this soon.,2
12/18/2014,Stuck at checking permission!! Htc m8,4
12/18/2014,Does not work on Nexus5 with lollipop,1
12/16/2014,"UPDATE: The latest version fixed the issue. Thanks, guys!                      Issue: The player cannot seem to go beyond the permission check. Need your help,  guys! This is becoming painful now. Running on Nexus 7 2013 on Lollipop 5.01. Thanks.",5
12/16/2014,"Now, it works on Android 5.0. Great!",5
12/16/2014,"I use this for it offline capabilities, which are good.   I have not been able to find a way to do the assessment through the app; nor are my bookmarks visible.  Perhaps just a single sign on linking getting the user to the site would be nice.  Through audio is spotty in full screen mode for some videos as well.",3
12/15/2014,"PluralSight is a fantastic service, but the app really falls short.  Absolutely no feature parity with the website: no bookmarks, doesn't sync progress between app and web accounts, and browse and search features are weaker. Stick with the mobile version of the website for now, because there's no benefit over it with this version of the app",2
12/15/2014,Offline content takes weeks to download. I get a module every 4 days or so and most courses are made up of a half dozen or more modules. I've contacted user support and the best they have is a suggestion to reinstall. Tried it. No joy.  Pretty lame for a company teaching software development.  Fix the downloads and I would up my rating to three stars.,2
12/15/2014,Its great to be able to watch on your mobile device but the watch offline feature is a little unwieldy and doesn't really instill any confidence that videos are actually downloading and they seem to download really slowly. It would be better if there was some sort of inbuilt download manager. I have a subscription to pluralsight so this is really a nice convenience but I wouldn't buy a subscription on the strength of this app alone.,3
12/15/2014,I'm starting to think I waste my money. I can't watch a video because it get stock in check permissions in any video.,1
12/15/2014,I would highly recommend for people who are hungry for knowledge,5
12/15/2014,"Pluralsight delivers great training material for different skills. This app allows me to plan my courses,  download them for offline training,  ideal when commuting.",5
12/14/2014,"This app is kind of a mess and it's a shame because I love using the Pluralsight computer based training.   First of all, any instance with authentication and &quot;checking permissions&quot; is really slow.  And why does it need to check permissions for each course once I am logged in? Second, None of the functionality of the website.  No dashboard.  No bookmarks.   Last, user interface is poorly designed with no help offered.  Browse a list of courses and you will be presented with book icons in green, yellow, and red.  What does this mean?  Is it the age of the material?  Popularity?  Let me look in the help menu....  Oh there isn't one.   Come on Pluralsight!  You are servicing computer professionals.  Can you act like it?",1

11/30/2014,Easy to use app with lots of great content,5
11/29/2014,"Downloads for offline use are to slow and can't protect my 3g data unless I turn it off completely. Zooming video would be a nice feature so I can read code on my phone,or at least stretch to page width. Now won't play at all,  just waits checking security",3
11/29/2014,Great App great site. Been learning a lot!,5
11/29/2014,"No bookmarks available in the mobile app, seems crazy to leave out something so fundamental to a mobile experience!",3
11/29/2014,Cannot log in on nexus 5 after Android 5 update. Says 'read timed out',1
11/29/2014,Works perfectly for me. I've developed a habit of syncing courses in the evening and watch them on my way to work... Very good..,5
11/29/2014,"Pluralsight is a great service but the app is less good. Can't get videos to play at all now, either streaming or download.",1
11/29/2014,True Story!,5
11/28/2014,"The app worked OK before my Nexus was updated to lollipop. Now, it won't even log in.",1
11/28/2014,"As soon as I try to watch a video, it goes to &quot;Checking permissions&quot; and goes nowhere else. Happens on every video on Nexus 7 w/lolipop",1
11/28/2014,I cannot even open the app. It crashes. Disappointed !,1
11/27/2014,"It works well on my phone, but won't let me login on my Nexus 7 running Android 5.0.",3
11/26/2014,Only fault is d landscape mode...audio dosent work correctly on landscape mode...otherwise awesome application....Good job...,4
11/25/2014,Good app but need more attention,4
11/24/2014,Overall the app is good.  I just wish the date of the lessons appeared in the list. Would also be nice to sort by that date.,4
11/24/2014,"Doesn't work at all in Android 5.0. Courses just don't play at all. Shame, lack of features aside, it worked perfectly in 4.x. Please fix...",1
11/24/2014,Never in sync with my recently viewed from PC content.. Consider yourself lucky enough for the day if the player plays the selected video for you.. But training material is of good quality,1
11/24/2014,"I love Pluralsight, and the content and quality of their videos is very impressive. It's a shame that their Android app is so poor. This really surprises me given that Pluralsight is a developer training company. The buffering doesn't work well. The viewing history isn't linked with your account. It doesn't update where I'm up to in a course reliably. Such a shame. Pluralsight - please update this to something that we would expect from a company such as yours. Also Chromecast support would be amazing!",2
11/23/2014,"This is not about the training. The training is top notch. For an IT training organization,  this is pretty embarrassing as a mobile offering. Lean on features and site parity and not very efficient at streaming the product. Lots of audio stuttering. Not ready for prime time. Love the training though. I guess the old saying stand those that cannot do, teach.",2
11/23/2014,The video just keeps showing the spinning wheel. Works okay on my tablet (with ice cream sandwich),3
11/23/2014,The newest tutorials are not shown.Why isn't this app not being updated ?,3
11/23/2014,I am entering my credentials but keep getting read time out error. Fix it,1
11/22/2014,Good. However sometimes after doing Pause it doesn't resume.,4
11/22/2014,Plural sight is second to none training. The app brings this great content anywhere. Well done!,5
11/22/2014,"Can't log in, can't download catalogue. Just doesn't work.",1
11/22/2014,"Great app, wish it would properly sync with the online account.",4
11/22/2014,So far good,4
11/22/2014,Good,5
11/22/2014,I always rely on pluralsight for their exceptional courses and they are always serious about providing best to the learners at affordable investment.,5
11/21/2014,running x2 video sound jitters,1
11/21/2014,Best IT online training,5
11/21/2014,Checking permission message all the time,1
11/21/2014,No chromecast support !,2
11/20/2014,"I have an annual subscription and able to view the content on my iPhone, via a browser but on my Nexus 6 it would not play a single content with getting stuck on checking permissions..... my review is based on the Nexus 6 experience but I love the content",1
11/20/2014,"Can't access your bookmarks, search does not come up with classes that you find on a desktop, clunky nav. Recent does not match what is recent on a desktop. Honestly I expected more due to the subject matter of the company.",2
11/20/2014,"The ability to save modules or courses you want to consume later would be extremely useful. As would the ability to sort by date, release, or more in depth topics. Love it though,Thanks!",4
11/19/2014,Recent tab does not update with the latest courses watched on other devices.,4
11/19/2014,Excelent Learning source,5
11/18/2014,It works well with simple listening and video. FF and REW are supported. No real issues.,4
11/16/2014,"Couldn't download any videos, stuck on 0%. In an attempt to fix that issue, reinstalled the app only for it to fail to login several times. Still doesn't download. This is unusable.",1
11/16/2014,Best in class....,4
11/16/2014,App sound skips and is unusable on the latest Nexus 7. I love pluralsight but this is frustrating.,1
11/16/2014,Great,5
11/16/2014,"I can't log in, I just get &quot;Read timed out&quot;. Makes the app worthless.",1
11/15/2014,Bullshit app,1
11/15/2014,"Love pluralsight, best training money I have spent. However... This app is useless on a nexus 9. Log on OK, but just displays checking permission on all content, and crashes. Not been able to watch a single clip on it... Very disappointed, hoping for a quick update!",1
11/15/2014,Video quality is great,4
11/14/2014,Awesome,5
11/13/2014,Very cool,4
11/13/2014,"One of the reason in buying the above tablet was to watch Pluralsight Courses.  As soon as I execute it, it crashes.  Seeing the last update was 11 months ago, I don't expect a fix any time soon.",1
11/12/2014,The audio skips in landscape on my galaxy S4. Canceling my subscription until its fix.,1
11/12/2014,"Tried one of the courses, and the video doesn't play smoothly",1
11/12/2014,"Offline downloading is just random. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. When it does, it is really slow. No option to see bookmarks which is a pain. No captions displayed on the videos. No option to take the assessments so one gets still forced to use the desktop. If you guys predict what you teach, you should have built a much better and functional app, not just a very very basic version of your website.",3
11/11/2014,Would be great if android supported Chromecast like the iOS version. Is odd why ios gets that over android.,4
11/11/2014,Would like to add the ability to star or favorite material.,4
11/11/2014,App hangs on my Nexus 9. Trying to login and the app just freezes.,1
11/11/2014,"In subscription fees, and you can't be bothered to make a good app? Very poor on Nexus 9.",2
11/10/2014,"I'll first start off by saying that the material on Pluralsight is fantastic. But you would think for a company with some of the best technical teaching resources around, they would be able to make a more stable app. I have an annual plus subscription, and am unable to watch courses or download any modules on my Galaxy S3. All my other apps requiring network wool work just fine. I don't have an issues on my iPad with either, and can watch everything just fine in my laptop.",2
11/8/2014,Excellent Product!!!,5
11/6/2014,"If I cannot see what is being demoed by the presenter then the whole point of having native app gets lost. I admire PluralSight for the content they have, but losing credibility by making wrongful claiming to have mobile app. I think they themself lost money in developing this app!",2
11/6/2014,Brilliant way to get access whilst travelling and very easy to find courses and use on the move,5
11/6/2014,"Cannot login on android L on a nexus 9, which makes the app fairly useless. Works fine on my nexus 5.",2
11/5/2014,Treasure of knowledge,5
11/5/2014,"I love plural sight, and this app works well for the most part. My only problem with it is that you can't zoom in while watching a video. That makes it hard - and sometimes impossible - to read the code the teachers are writing in the videos. As a whole, though, I certainly recommend the app.",4
11/5/2014,Could be better if that bug is fixed.,3
11/4/2014,Terrible stuttering playback in either offline or online on my new LG G3.  Unusable.  Maybe they should create a course for writing stable Android apps!,1
11/4/2014,All signin attempts failed with read time out error. Mobile OS build LPV79 (ANDROID L).,1
11/3/2014,"I was torn between giving a three or a four star rating, so I settled for the former because not getting an updated status of my course viewing on other devices is a big problem. Also, it would be nice to have an &quot;add to wishlist&quot; feature.",3
11/2/2014,One of the best self learning  apps known to me. This is my  teacher.,5
11/1/2014,Cool app.. Watching it offline makes it really cool 😎,4
11/1/2014,"Unable to login at all. App is fine, the backend is broken.",1
11/1/2014,Like another user mentioned ...this App  does not work at all!!,1
10/31/2014,Offline doesn't work anymore and crashes a lot. Developer doesn't maintain it,1
10/31/2014,"I need to download 2MB worth of catalog almost every time? playback freezes on speed &gt;= 1.5 even if offline content, one thing that I've noticed helps is to go airplane mode, so look into the background data processes maybe.",2
10/29/2014,The playback on the Nexus 5 lags alot after watching a couple of minutes. Cant access my bookmarks.,2
10/29/2014,"Pluralsight is a great site but this app is a shocker!                         Downloading simply does not work, courses freeze almost all the time when playing online.",1
10/29/2014,This app sucks. Can't buffer the video. I have full cell service and the video keeps hanging up.,1
10/28/2014,"Can't believe they're is still no Chromecast support for Android. Also, should be able to pick up progress from app to web and back. Ability to do assessments in the app would also make sense. When Chromecast for Android is implemented, I will raise one star.",3
10/28/2014,"First the app downloads the content to device *really slowly*, even on my fast work network - at a fraction of the speed that other apps like my podcast player and the coursera app. Second, the app randomly gets into this start-crash mode, that is only fixed by a data reset on the app. That two things together makes for a horrible user experience. It also means that their premium subscription is useless, because the offline storage gets corrupted every so often.",1
10/25/2014,Best training content ever. Excellent tutors.,5
10/24/2014,The app stutters quite often.   No option for downloading (that i know of).    No way to bookmark!?  No playlists!?,2
10/24/2014,"Seems to delete any downloaded content soon after it's downloaded, rendering the feature useless. Shame, as no other complaints beyond this much needed feature.",2
10/23/2014,"It's very fast and clean, I use it when I'm in the train.",5
10/21/2014,"Application seems basic and Ok, but keep getting jitters in the sound. Works fine on my phone S5.",3
10/20/2014,"Offline module playback is not smooth, stuttering makes it impossible to follow the courses.",2
10/20/2014,"On my Samsung Tab 4 8inch Videos skip or stutter when in landscape mode for full screen videos, in portrait mode they dont skip but that is useless to watch them like that. Also I dont have this problem on my 2 year old Samsung Tab 2 7inch. So the company that is supposed to be showing me how to use technology cant even get it right and its been broken for months now.",1
10/19/2014,I find that these videos stream better on this app than on my computer.,5
10/19/2014,It works and mostly stays out of the way of learning.,4
10/19/2014,"Just blown a months mobile data leaving this app to download offline content. Most of the download was overnight on wifi, but looks like it carried on while I was on the train on 4g... I suggest an option is added to only download offline content when on wifi. I've disabled background download now, in the phone settings, but still carries on downloading when I'm using the app. That was a pricy mistake I won't do again.",3
10/18/2014,"I can't see my bookmarks on the app. Logging in is strange in that I need my username, not my email, and there is no option to recover a forgotten password. It's a very plain app with absolute minimal functionality, and there have been no real features added in a long time. It needs some TLC.",2
10/18/2014,It's OK. Crashes quite often on my Nexus10. Have to hard reboot it. Easier to use the web app.,3
10/17/2014,Phone is 6.5 inch and handles other video beautifully. Just not this app.,3
10/16/2014,very usful app,5
10/15/2014,Really easy to download video and play offline,5
10/15/2014,Unable to watch the videos in either full screen or landscape mode. No bookmarks.,1
10/13/2014,Excellent app!,5
10/12/2014,Would have given 5 but Comcast is essential,4
10/11/2014,"Please add chromecast support. Also If it loses connection for a second, it is not able to reconnect which is a big drawback on mobile devices.",3
10/11/2014,Truly amazing,5
10/11/2014,No forgot username function,1
10/10/2014,"Last update in 2013, development simply is stopped.   Not worth subscription if you rely solely on Android to view it.",1
10/9/2014,Amazing source for learning.,5
10/9/2014,"Works amazingly, quick load times, no problems 1 hour in.  Don't know how other people are experiencing problems.  I am using the One Plus 64GB phone.",4
10/9/2014,"What about Chromecast , you have it in your ios app",4
10/8/2014,Seems to not be synced with the bookmarks on the desktop version which is a little obnoxious.  When you do find the series you are on it does have what you've watched checked correctly so that is a relief.,4
10/8/2014,Thought this would know where I left off...nothing saved from computer browser based paid sessions...could be improved. Also did not like email logon and asked for username instead. Glad I remembered it. Even this rating text box works oddly constantly wanting to select...,3
10/8/2014,Need to restart my Note 3 too many times.  I don't like the fact that you have to leave the app open at all times either.,2
10/8/2014,"nice to have the tutorials accessible on the go, would love it if speaker notes could be seen as well.",4
10/8/2014,No complaints on the existing feature set. I use it to watch courses while commuting to and from work.  Most missed feature are to sync bookmarks which I create on the web.,3
10/8/2014,"The applications is super, and the UI and navigation is fine, but I can't figure out how can I refresh (update) the course catalog? I saw it get updated from more than 3 weeks, and from that time, I can't get the new added courses, and even when opening while connecting to the internet, the app is not updating the catalog from time to time as I used to get on the IOS one.  if there is something I'm missing or a hidden command which I should trigger, please let me know, other than this annoying issue, everything is just great.",4
10/8/2014,Works great for me on OppoN1 running CyanogenMod,5
10/7/2014,Its giving me http 403 access denied error on my Nexus 5,1
10/6/2014,Awesome app..  You can learn using your mobile device.. What else can you ask for?,5
10/5/2014,"Audio jerky, broken. Still using the website.",2
10/4/2014,Can not open app on vega A870,1
10/4/2014,Works great on moto x,5
10/1/2014,"It's sad, because that's the whole point of this app. To watch the video library on-the-go, but they skip, audio falls out of sync, and the videos stall and this is on WiFi. Hard to believe I'm paying a monthly subscription for terrible service. Also, you can't even access your bookmarks. It seems Pluralsight doesn't care about their customers experience so long as you keep blindly paying your subscription.",1
10/1/2014,it crashes a lot but good content though,2
9/29/2014,This app will be great if I can view courses I've bookmarked,4
9/29/2014,"Download works well, streaming works well, the app is easy to navigate. Search could be tidied and improved a bit as you don't get too much info when looking through the course names. Generally happy with the application though and is a welcome addition to the browser version.",4
9/28/2014,Its very useful app and had good content in videos and the explanation also simple n clear.,4
9/26/2014,Would like to see the app pull in my bookmarked videos and perhaps have the ability to push the video to my TV like the YouTube app can.,4
9/26/2014,The app stoppes if is not in front. We should be able to listen without reading. Samsung S4,4
9/26/2014,"Like so many before me have commented , the audio stutters in landscape mode, especially in full screen. Shameful app for a company that prides itself on technology and education. Please add bookmarking and Synching them across devices. - Very frustrating",2
9/24/2014,"i use pluralsight on pc, ios and android the only system it crashes is on the android have submitted reports uninstalled lots of times but still does it",1
9/24/2014,The pluralsight content is great and this application is a fine handheld way to obtain it.,4
9/23/2014,Love it!,5
9/23/2014,You find a better all in training software than this one.,5
9/23/2014,Gr8 collection of tutorials,5
9/23/2014,A must-have for those who want to keep up-to-date.,4
9/22/2014,The best tutorials,5
9/22/2014,Takes time to load. Didn't get the option for maximising the window,3
9/22/2014,It is an awesome experience learning with pluralsight. You can experience n learn at same time.,4
9/22/2014,Choose which video/lesson to watch and sit back. Have not done any offline viewing and have always been on a WiFi connection... Loading can be a bit redundant when you pause and then resume but all-in-all I'm pleased,5
9/22/2014,"If you're willing to deal with technical issues, the content of the app is actually quite useful and interesting.",4
9/21/2014,Great for learning,5
9/21/2014,Really great tutorials. Thanks!,5
9/20/2014,back in March and still not bringing it to Android still = 1 star,1
9/18/2014,"Update: even after months of complaints this app has not been updated to fix the smallest of bugs. The  content is great but the app sucks.  Used up almost 1.5 GB of data trying to download 3 courses.  Needs more features: download only on wifi, sync between devices, chrome cast (iOS app already has it but android app doesn't which totally doesn't make sense).",1
9/17/2014,Works gr8 in nexus 7 tab,4
9/17/2014,I learned a lot from it and still learning. It very easy and very well explained..,5
9/16/2014,"Samsung 10 in tablet, the app has frozen a few times on certain lessons but overall its a nice alternative for studying on the couch. Just went back to the app and it wont open even after a restart. I'll try uninstalling, it worked fine until I left a favorable comment",3
9/16/2014,Lately all video stutters and chokes. Works great on my iPad. Lately performance on my S3 makes me want to go back to iPhone.,2
9/16/2014,"Who really wants to watch a 40 minute video on their phone. Why no chromecast? Seems like a must for an app like this. The performance is terrible, popping sounds on almost all of the videos that I sampled from a 60 Mbps WiFi connection.",1
9/16/2014,Great App for on - the - move learning. Robust and simple to use.,5
9/16/2014,Crashes when I open it,1
9/16/2014,"There are so many bugs and poor implementation decisions in this app, I can't fit them all in one post. This is really too bad, because pluralsight has excellent videos. But if you want to use android as your main viewing device, DO NOT PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION! You will just get angry. Why? This app: constantly eats up your data quota - you cannot set DL on wifi, videos don't or often take days to DL, then DL'ed videos often delete themselves, it sometimes locks up phone,  audio stutters, & more! Horrible!",1
9/16/2014,Is not good. Tried to remove a single module and all of them got removed. Also there is no way to prioritize which module to download first.,3
9/14/2014,How is it that the iOS version has Chromecast support and the Android version does not? Please add this in the next version!!,3
9/14/2014,Nice app.. Looks great on 4+ inch mobiles and tablets,5
9/13/2014,The offline experience needs improvements,1
9/13/2014,Great lectures.  Thanks,4
9/12/2014,Not a bad one. UI has room for improvement.,3
9/12/2014,Ok app but volume comes out too low. I wish there were more audio options available,3
9/11/2014,"Like others have commented before, audio shuttering issue on nexus 5 is making it very hard to use the app. Please fix.",1
9/11/2014,Please add a feature to control the quality of the video streaming similar to the one that is available on your website. Otherwise it's a great app and let's me watch and learn things on the go.,3
9/11/2014,"I downloaded some modules,  a VERY slow process,  and attempted to watch the video in landscape. The video is unwatchable while in landscape,  portrait works fine.  I think I will stick with watching the videos on my desktop.",2
9/11/2014,"Easy to use, simple and good control. It'd be great if the transcript also available, or is it?",4
9/10/2014,"Trying to download content for offline usage is painful at the best of times. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.  The biggest issue is, if you are lucky enough to have offline content, then you can't play it in landscape mode with out the audio and video skipping. Watching complex screencasts in portrait mode isn't what I want to be paying a large monthly sum for at all.",1
9/10/2014,This application keep crashing.need to re install again for offline viewing,1
9/10/2014,Pluralsight is the best! I'd like if it was able to zoom in\out the videos in the app! Great work guys!,5
9/10/2014,Without bookmark support this app is very difficult to pick up and use quickly. If this feature were to be implemented it would be a five star review.,2
9/9/2014,I would give it a 5 star if they fixed the downloading of offline viewing. It takes me 1 to 3hours to download the whole course. I cant even surpass the 100kbps mark.,2
9/9/2014,The last update was Dec 2013. Are we getting more than one update every 12 months??? Please include chromecast support in the next update!!,4
9/8/2014,"This app sucks. Seriously. 20 minutes checking permissions on a course and still not done? Do you send a fax somewhere and wait for the fax to come back with an OK? Monthly plus subscription.... WiFi... UPDATE: turns out that the service is down. Perfect timing. Will re-rate, when they get things up again.",1
9/8/2014,"Now that chromecast support has been out for sometime this app needs and should already have support. Also, it doesn't work.",1
9/8/2014,"Love being able to get training on my Android on a bus, in a park, or practically anywhere!  Recommend a high quality screen as it was difficult to view on the tiny screen on my old smart phone.  If the downloaded offline modules were not disappearing, I would give 5 stars.",4
9/8/2014,The app feels really old and not as user friendly and modern as it could be and there is no Chromecast support yet...,3
9/7/2014,Offline caching on mobile (I have a note 2) is faulty. It gets deleted on its own. So need to download several times. Also at times the download starts although I have paused download in mobile data mode.,2
9/7/2014,In landscape mode the audio is spastic making it unusable.,2
9/7/2014,Works great.,5
9/7/2014,"Great to be able to download content and use offline, v important for commuters, but sound quality isn't fantastic in full screen mode, you can't take assessments in the app either :-(",4
9/6/2014,Pretty good,4
9/6/2014,Needs bookmark sync,2
9/6/2014,Does not work at all on my smartphone,1
9/5/2014,Great app,5
9/5/2014,It's very frustrating that it doesn't sync progress between web app and android app.,1
9/4/2014,Missing bookmarks,4
9/4/2014,"What I'm missing in this app is to conveniently search through the courses of some author, and then related or recommended courses our similar functionality.",4
9/4/2014,Great app for a great service,5
9/3/2014,Wild be great if this app had the ability to use ChromeCast.,3
9/2/2014,This is one of the practical tutorials that i came across...simplified and worth having it...,4
9/1/2014,Nice. Handy app,4
9/1/2014,The course viewing interface works as good as one can expect. The absence of syncing at least the bookmarks is an inconvenience.  I have to access my online account to see which courses I have bookmarked.,4
9/1/2014,I've tried to save modules for offline to help the choppy video playback but that does not change anything. Also tried different Wifi and cellular network connections but still experience the issue. This does not happen if you keep it in portrait mode where video is smaller and works great on their website on the desktop.,3
9/1/2014,Wish it would listen to the &quot;lock screen&quot; option.,4
8/31/2014,Pluralsight is awesome.,5
8/31/2014,Does what it says on the tin.,4
8/30/2014,"Works great, especially tablets.",4
8/30/2014,Good app for very valuable courses,4
8/29/2014,Great app!,5
8/29/2014,Fantastic site!,5
8/29/2014,Haven't used this for some time. Just tried downloading it again and now I can't even login. Http 403 error message.  Fix it please.,1
8/28/2014,Could use some design improvements but the functionality is there.,4
8/28/2014,Issues while playing videos. Audio breaks constantly. HTC one m8,2
8/27/2014,Great,5
8/27/2014,"Fragmented sound while watching horizontally or full screen. Unfortunately, without full screen , the application is useless. Hope it will be solved.  I'd love to be able to use it, full screen. The contents are greate!",2
8/26/2014,I just started using this app but i see one issue already. I cannot believe the app does not know what courses I bookmarked via the web browser. That should be basic functionality. I should at least be able to bookmark courses to follow later from within the app.,2
8/26/2014,"The content on pluralsight is fantastic, however the app needs some work. It's very plain looking, confusing to use and I have seen so many complaints about people losing their downloaded content that it stopped me from purchasing the $49 subscription. The entire reason I wanted to purchase the $49 subscription was for the offline content. The app needs some love!   The content on pluralsights website is A++ though.",3
8/25/2014,Awesome explanation,5
8/25/2014,Great app let you travel and learn on the go,4
8/25/2014,Needs sync across devices,5
8/25/2014,"It's a great app to keep in smartphone. UI is good and works great with wifi and 3g..if offline option is added will be very helpful, ,",5
8/24/2014,This app works well for what it is which is a great app to study theory away from the computer. It works better on my iphone but works ok on my galaxy tab turned to portrait orientation.  PluralSight overall is outstanding!,4
8/24/2014,Have good ui,4
8/24/2014,Good App,4
8/24/2014,Works great :),4
8/24/2014,This app is always crashing in my tablet(samsung note 8),1
8/24/2014,This has the option to view training offline. That's great to view trainings on the go.,5
8/23/2014,Video doesn't play just keeps loading,1
8/23/2014,"I watch these videos sped up, but with this mobile app, this causes the sound to become increasingly stuttery, even on my Nexus 5. Does not support Chromecast.",3
8/23/2014,Very convenient and user friendly.,5
8/23/2014,Loving it,5
8/23/2014,Love this and so does my brain!,5
8/21/2014,Love it !!!,4
8/21/2014,"Awesome, I can learn everywhere.",5
8/20/2014,"Works very well most of the time, it still does take time to buffer, but once buffering is done it usually works as intended.",4
8/19/2014,Excellent platform.. For learning things on the go..,5
8/18/2014,Really poor,1
8/17/2014,Like the app from what i've seen so far.  Keep up the good work pluralsight,5
8/17/2014,Now I have my learning on the go. Cool app.,4
8/17/2014,Great,4
8/17/2014,Needs syncing with website bookmarks and progress. Annoying that no offline access without premium subscription. Working well enough for me otherwise.,3
8/16/2014,"Intuitive, performs great on my samsung Galaxy Note 10",5
8/15/2014,Must have tool for every IT professional,4
8/15/2014,this is more of a proof of concept than a usable player,1
8/15/2014,I like it ... best so far.,4
8/15/2014,"Well as far as playing the videos is concerned, it is fine. However not being able to use my email address to login was a bad start (it is hard enough remembering passwords let alone usernames). The second problem was not being able to get to the history and bookmarks of courses I've previously accessed via the web. How can you have so many excellent courses on software development, yet then fall so short on your own software?",3
8/15/2014,I love Pluralsight but hated this app because of playback issues but after installing new update it seems like its fixed.,4
8/15/2014,Thank you for everything we have learned at pluralsight :),5
8/14/2014,So sad that this app worked better on my Nexus 7 2012. Audio just stutters on my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and the video doesn't seem perfectly fluid either.,1
8/14/2014,Well made and lovely to use!,5
8/13/2014,Awesome app!!!,5
8/12/2014,"I found this app indispensable for when I'm on the move as I can catch up on content with my tablet. However, I've found that it's not the most stable, and can't play videos at more than 1x without stuttering.  It would be good if these issues can be sorted out.",3
8/12/2014,Especially for when I'm not at home,5
8/10/2014,"I love having the videos on the go, and the added features rock!  Are there plans to include the Digital Tutors videos? That would be awesome!!!",5
8/10/2014,Cool app,4
8/9/2014,Well done and the training portability is very nice.,5
8/9/2014,"The lessons are great, easy to follow.",5
8/9/2014,"Good, however, I can't play videos some time unless I have a wifi connection.",4
8/9/2014,Audio/video stuttering at its worst,1
8/8/2014,There is nothing free in it.,1
8/6/2014,Best money I have ever spent. Thank you. My gym money is on this website. I'm not fat but my mind is. Great vids and excellent tutors.. Have picked up a lot of tips. And I just suscribed  a week ago,5
8/6/2014,"I originally had issues with the offline viewing, however, the support was pretty great and fairly quick. Seems like the issue is resolved. In any case, I highly recommend this as its fairly cheap in regards to training, particularly if you plan on doing more than one in a month or two. Some online training can cost hundreds of dollars for just one course. This allows access to a slew of training for a low monthly (or annual cost... and the annual cost can be similar to just one online course). I do wish bookmarks were more accessible in the app.",4
8/6/2014,"Great site, good app...",4
8/4/2014,"Doesn't even give a chance to play a single video on my DROIDX2. Submitted technical support ticket, no response.",1
8/4/2014,"Seamless video play, enjoyed learning with it on the go.",5
8/4/2014,"I was looking forward to studying on the go but this app doesn't work on my device. The audio is crackly, out of sync and jumps every few seconds. Videos close themselves whilst I'm watching them. This is the same when buffering online content or watching offline modules. Will be reconsidering my subscription.",1
8/3/2014,Pre loading and caching will ease network issues.  Downloading or some kind of offline mode will help to view anywhere without network.  Downloads can be encrypted fir the mobile app only and thus don't have to be a pro subscription.,3
8/2/2014,Lots of material! Great learning resource!,5
8/2/2014,30 modules is too less for offline quota.. users should be give unlimited offline quota based on their subscription...,4
8/1/2014,Basic ui.... not much eye candy.,4
7/31/2014,Lots of great topics and content. Really need a bookmarking feature. It's available online but not the mobile version.,4
7/31/2014,Huge range of courses all clear and easy to follow,5
7/31/2014,"I would prefer to be able to see the module duration somewhere though. I keep having to scroll through the segments and count up the minutes. Bit annoying. Apart from that, it's awesome.",5
7/30/2014,Knowledge in your hands,5
7/30/2014,Indispensable for any sw engineer,5
7/29/2014,"Content ie great. Bring in more and I am loyal.  UI doesnt look great. Also, doesn't show my complete recent list from other devices. Should be able to zoom while video is playing.",3
7/28/2014,"I love watching tutorials,  and these are by far the best tutorials I've seen. Well presented and easy to follow. Definitely recommend this app and a subscription!",5
7/28/2014,Application and the courses are really helpful,5
7/27/2014,Great app,4
7/27/2014,Really benefiting from the content of these courses but the streaming quality of the app it's quite poor. Since I spend most of my time watching courses on my Android device it's quite disappointing.,2
7/27/2014,Cold boot does not resolve the problem.  I am up to date on the app version.,1
7/26/2014,Voice is not clear having lots of broken voice. Application looks slow,1
7/24/2014,It is very Laggy unless I hold my tablet sideways. Full screen doesn't work well for this reason.otherwise it does what I want,4
7/24/2014,"In theory its fine as an app if it worked properly. Audio stutters in landscape, out of sync in portrait. Tested on 60mb and o2 4g",2
7/24/2014,Excellent,5
7/24/2014,"As many others have said, the PluralSight content is fantastic but this app is just ruined by the offline mode. The offline cache is crap and will only download items to it while your screen is active. Add to this it's tendency to delete its contents randomly and you really have a completely unusable feature (the PRIMARY feature that anyone with a premium sub is probably looking to use). Given how the PluralSight content is so passionate about quality software and content, I genuinely cannot believe they are putting their name to this shoddy piece of crap. To be totally honest, this app has lowered my opinion of the company itself.",1
7/23/2014,I ve been using plural sight for long and is very helpful for Microsoft products,5
7/23/2014,"The app is simple and easy to use, however, when I change orientation of my device, the video and audio degrades drastically. Also, adding the ability to cast the videos using chromecast would be really great!",4
7/23/2014,Great source of knowledge,5
7/22/2014,Works pretty good. Ive learned a good amount just watching while riding to work,4
7/22/2014,Does not show bookmarked courses. Boggles the mind as to why not.,3
7/22/2014,"I use this app while traveling so I learn, a lot during my traveling. You can also try:)",5
7/21/2014,I'm taking a couple of courses and if I've taken over my pc don't refresh over my mobile app.,4
7/21/2014,Learning on the go!,5
7/20/2014,No ability to download and I can't stream what is basically an overgrown PowerPoint presentation with audio without the audio being unbearably choppy. This poor performance is over an Internet connection that is just fine (I just tested it) streaming HD video. Completely unacceptable and may cause me to not proceed past my trial subscription.,1
7/20/2014,"Missing the Chromecast extension. Pretty disappointing that iOS received google technology before Android. If this changes, I'll change my rating to 5 stars.",3
7/20/2014,Downloads same videos time and again,1
7/20/2014,"Basic but its good for watching on the go. Perfect video, but very choppy sound on both of my tablets and phone no matter what network I'm on makes it frustrating to listen to.",3
7/20/2014,I do a lot of moving from department to department as part of the job.  With this app I cam train during the long walks or while waiting for end users to be ready for on site assitance,5
7/19/2014,"Works great on my iPad, but the Android app is a hunk of s$&@! It might be better if it could first download the content for local play. As it stands now, this app is useless on Android. Streaming is super choppy, despite a fantastic connection to the Internet.",1
7/19/2014,"Its breaking up in some videos, not sure if thats the case only in mobiles.",4
7/18/2014,It doesn't do anything,1
7/18/2014,It's a good app and service. My only wish is you add support for chromecast so i could play videos on my tv.,4
7/18/2014,Excellent online course library. ..,5
7/17/2014,I use this app every day on my lunch.,5
7/17/2014,"Best training and video streaming android app, hands down.   Has offline cache and remembers where I left off with multiple courses.",5
7/16/2014,Good,5
7/15/2014,I enjoy the app.  When will you add Chromecast?,4
7/15/2014,"It's providing the plurasight wonderfull librairies on the go, just great",5
7/15/2014,"If it were a little bit faster, would be even better.",5
7/15/2014,Nice,4
7/14/2014,Awesome work guys,5
7/14/2014,Great app,5
7/12/2014,"The app, coupled with phone mirroring on my ChromeCast works brilliantly. Not true ChromeCast support but it works and allows me to watch on my big screen.",5
7/11/2014,"Their training videos are awsome.  However, they dont fit on smaller displays very well.  I think they could improve that.",4
7/10/2014,There should be feature to set buffering on WiFi only. So that mobile data can be saved.,1
7/10/2014,"As with comment 2 months ago, cant open on samsung s3. Crashes as soon as it is opened.",1
7/9/2014,I have a 3 year old Asus tablet and this works perfectly.  Great app.,4
7/9/2014,"Love plural sight generally, but only giving the app 3 because on this tablet the audio regularly breaks up, to the point of frustration that I have to give up",3
7/8/2014,Can not watch any videos since the videos seem to not play properly in any size. Very poor performance,2
7/8/2014,Very helpful as other online course is not depth or not industry level. But pluralsight is perfect and I as a lead developer in a software company recommend to developers,5
7/7/2014,I particularly like the ability to download courses for watching off line,4
7/7/2014,"Need ability to bookmark courses, also, what is up with the color coding of course with no legend?",4
7/6/2014,Lectures provided rival lectures from undergrad.  Very thorough.,5
7/6/2014,I am able to review training material at any time now.  I love the small incremental training.  All features work reliable and no crashes so far. Thanks Plural sight.,5
7/6/2014,The mobile app does justice to the desktop site and I find the learning experience good. Waiting for chromecast feature for this mobile app videos. Will love to cast it on bigger screen.,4
7/6/2014,Helpful app,4
7/6/2014,Searching needs a bit of improvement,4
7/6/2014,This is by far the best website for learning or reviewing development as well as practical it skills.,5
7/6/2014,"It does not work at all on my Moto G. None of the links, menus display their content. Search does not display any result. In short useless.",1
7/5/2014,"On the train, at the coffee shop, at school, i still cant get enough of it. using it since 2011",5
7/5/2014,Freezes on my note 2014 tablet,2
7/4/2014,Wonderful app,5
7/3/2014,Nice App good content.,5
7/3/2014,I found this app the best way to view Pluralsight videos on my tablet,5
7/3/2014,"I like the concept and the functionality , but the player is awful. The playback of locally stored video skips and cuts out making it almost unuseable.",3
7/2/2014,Content rocks. App sucks,1
7/2/2014,The lag on the video audio is terrible. I have a fibre broadband and streaming is terrible. On the Web no issue.,2
7/2/2014,Nice,5
7/2/2014,good one,5
7/2/2014,"No Chromecast Support Videos buffer strangely.  Doesn't let you log in on Android L, but since that's a beta it's not a big deal, just something to be mindful of.",3
7/2/2014,Does what its suppose to do,5
6/30/2014,Rocket science on the move well done. Any chance of making it work with Google Cast?,5
6/30/2014,App is very cool functionality wise but sometime it is unresponsive and crashes.,4
6/30/2014,Excellent,5
6/30/2014,"Download offline doesn't work.. If I download more than two modules.. When trying to play a video it stalls. When restarting phone and opening app, it appears to start downloading the same content again. Forever.",1
6/29/2014,Love it,5
6/29/2014,Good. My only complaint is that it does not sync history with the web.,4
6/29/2014,Gud for watching video on-demand @ pluralsight,5
6/28/2014,Nice app for developers,4
6/28/2014,"The videos frames froze on the tablet, I had to tilt or maximize/restore the video to force a refresh to the current frame. I had no problems on phone.",1
