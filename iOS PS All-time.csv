12/29/2018,"Great content, quirky implementation","Critique applies to iOS app, not course content:

1) Courses downloaded to device for offline viewing are not eligible for casting (iOS to Google Chromecast).  What is the business purpose of this?  I download the content so I don‚Äôt burn through my data plan while commuting, then must deselect the download option to cast it once I get home to continue studying.  Then, before I leave the next morning, I must download the content again.  

2) App becomes unstable when Chromecasting.  Anything more than 2 ten second rewinds in a row will cause the app to encounter casting disconnect, syncing, or create a non-responsive environment, requiring app force close and restart.  I also encounter other misc failures and I‚Äôm willing to provide logs, if applicable.  

I appreciate any help with these issues.  All apps and iOS updates current as of today‚Äôs date.

Lately, I have been enjoying the courses which show a variety professional effects like, Maya Dynamics: Common Effects Techniques because they show sophisticated situations that light a creative fire, as opposed to more basic demonstrations. Right now, I wish there were more courses on dynamics such as fluids and particles. I have watched all of what is available in that category.

5/22/2017,Chromecast issue,"I am having an issue when Chrome casting. While it's streaming to the tv if the phone screen turns off it will continue casting, which is fine, but when I turn the screen back on, the app acts like it's not casting. Pressing play for example, will then start the video on the phone while it's still playing on the tv. This requires me to resetup the cast causing the video being casted to start again. This bug only occurred rarely before the update but happens every time now. Temporary solution of course is to not let the phones screen turn off and to never switch apps. Hopefully this can be fixed soon. Cheers and thanks for a great app and service! (5 stars cause I know you'll look into this)",ctdewberry,5,2.23

1/26/2017,Great content. Buggy app.,"The content is great. The app drives me crazy. The buttons are too small, so it tries to play the video when I'm trying to download. They have hidden the speed control so you have to swipe down to see it, but sometimes it doesn't open or opens several seconds later. And worst of all, I have an Annual Plus subscription and pretty much only use the app instead of the web site so I can download videos and watch them when I don't have access to Wifi. However, lately I guess they have gotten aggressive on timing out the authentication token, so now I frequently get the error ""This module isn't available under your current subscription"" when I try to watch a downloaded video. Once I get wifi again, then it lets me play it.",Garl Grimslade,4,2.17
1/24/2017,"Good app, but signs you up for automatic renewal","I have an account with Pluralsight on their web site, and was happy to see they came out with this app, so I can study on my iPad when I'm out of the house. I pay month-to-month on the website, since I don't always need it, so I might pay for a month, then not pay for several months. Auto-renewaal is disabled on the website.

However, I downloaded this app, logged in, and since my web-account status was ""not subscribed"", I was prompted to pay my $30 monthly fee to re-activate my account, which I did. I used the app and studied for an exam, and was wanting to let the subscription expire at the end of 30 days. I even went to the web site and made sure ""auto-renewal"" was unchecked. 

Well, this morning I received a receipt from the Apple Store for my $30.00 ""auto-renewal subscription"" fee from the Pluralsight app! I went through the entire app looking for a way to access my account/subscription settings, but there is nothing there. I finally had to call the Apple Store, wait on hold, and be walked through the process of going into my settings, then ""app store"", click my user id, click ""subscriptions"", and there, lo and behold, I see I was signed up for ""automatic renewal"".

I contacted PluralSight and they showed me that the app, when you sign up, the default is set to show ""Subscription Terms: This Subscription will Automatically Renew Every Month for $29.99"", and then there is another button after that to confirm, which states ""Confirm Subscription - This subscription will continue unless cancelled..."" So to be fair, there are two warnings/confirmations, and as usualy, I probably just clicked them and forgot about it. Luckily, Apple cancelled the transaction. It was all my fault, but it's like...they are signing me up for automatic renewal and not giving me to option NOT to. Now ""I"" have to go to settings and unsubscribe. I don't know it that is Apple's deal or Pluralsight, but I know when I purchase other ""In-App Purchases"" in apps, it is a one-time deal.

I have to download part of the course I want to watch, and while that's bearable, when downloaded videos refuse to play it's not! Its little embarrassing for highly technical company (or should I say two companies) to have such a buggy app for such a long time as I can see from all reviews.

There's a lot of functionality found on the website that simply was not translated over to the mobile app. It is extremely difficult to find videos that you've already been watching on the website. The search function is not incredibly useful. You not have the ability to find bookmarks created on the website nor do you have the ability to create bookmarks within the app. This is the same for playlist as well.

The app just spins when I try to access courses!   I purchase for my company.  One of the reasons I chose Pluralsight was for the mobile support.

This has two negative impacts on the users. First, it can be very confusing trying to find where you left off.  The bigger issue is that if you are using   Pluralsight to qualify learning hours for a certification and the app doesn't sync your progress, you will need to watch content more than once to get credit for it.

Playing back works fine most of the time when just using the iPhone, but casting to an AppleTV via Airplay just doesn't work reliably enough. About 50% of the time after a chapter finishes it will fail to advance and just spin the progress indicator forever. This does not occur when only viewing through the iPhone. If fixed this would be a 5 star app. One trick to get it to not stop after chapters is to use a chromecast, set your iPhone to NEVER auto lock, turn down the screen brightness to dave battery, then let it rip. It will not stop after chapters this way, although thats not an ideal way to have to use the app.",Stonedauwg,2,2.2
1/8/2016,"Awful, useless search feature","As a former PeepCode subscriber, the PluralSight app is very disappointing.  The search feature is essentially useless, because it returns a full list of matches to individual chapters, and it returns the, in a narrow pop-up.  You can't see enough information about the search results to know anything about them.

For example, search in the app for ""SharePoint"". Your results will say, ""SharePoint 2010 Documentation/Meet..."", ""SharePoint Server 2020 Administr..."", ""SharePoint 2013 Advance..."", and about a hundred other results.  Those are chapter titles, not titles for whole videos, so there is an enormous pile of results, and no way to evaluate them.

You basically have to search using their web site, then navigate by categories to find the video.  Ugh...

Update: This app is getting better but it's still awful.  The only reason I downloaded the latest version was to try to AirPlay videos, since the web version of Pluralsight doesn't support that.  The app has that feature but it doesn't work.",Ryan-in-Miami,2,2.2

Original review
The app provides a simple way to stream content from the PluralSight website but it is far too basic to even be considered on par with the advanced concepts they are presenting.  For shame.  Rudimentary search, no bookmarking, no notes, no favorites, etc. Hopefully these items will be addressed at some point.
Finally the most recent update simply allows you to more easily return to what you were watching but it's a small upgrade that does very little to raise the quality of this app.  Don't let this detract from the great content, though.  Looking forward to future updates.",mcarthey,4,2.1

11/9/2015,Hate!,"Nothing can describe the white hot hate I have for this app. You have to pay extra to use it. The one reason for me to pay extra for this was i could down load videos and use them on the train. With this it doesn't work unless you are  logged in the whole time, i guess to make sure we suddenly don't steal the videos midway through watching them, so not only do I have to use my data allotment on my phone, if I lose connection out goes my video. Thus defeats the purpose of my purchase of the higher priced subscription. I didn't like the last app but it was miles better. Plus the menus are frustrating, why does it force me straight into the first course? 

There is no love for people with no data plan on their I pad from plural sight anymore. I guess I'm suppose to use this in my house only.

Previous comment: I gave 2 stars becoz it is still missing some features that are so necessary and should be aware by professional programmers like u guys. 1. Bookmarks, 2. Show latest video list, 3 sync the watch list across different devices, 4. active task would switched to itune music if I change the volume from a bluetooth connected device (like my Toyota sienna), which is quite annoyed.  5. I wish it support multitasking since some of the courses here are like podcast that I don't need to look at the screen in order to enjoy it, so I can still do other stuff on my iPad. 6. Last but not least, I found a lot of courses have such a long name that they can't even display full name on the list or player header...
Anyway, it is a stable player but sometime I still need to use browser to 'locate' what I want to watch next before I can start.

And label the courses so that you know what order they are designed to be watched in without just looking at the publish date and hoping they were published in order.

10/17/2015,"Content is Great, Important Features Still Lacking","Updated October 17, 2015:

Worse than ever. I love the content, but the iOS app is an embarrassment. Quite frankly, after several years in the App Store, it is irresponsible of Pluralsight to not invest in a complete rewrite. 

======================

As others have mentioned, the content is great. I've learned a tremendous amount, thanks to Pluralsight's content and the ability to access it through this app. The actual video playback works well, but...

...I am very surprised that the app is still missing:

- An easy and quick way to access a category (how difficult is it to add a simple drop down?).

- Access to bookmarks.

- The ability for in-video specific time bookmarks (also needed on the websites).

- Access to the recently watched list.

- The ability to change the ""watched"" status of a video (also desperately needed on the website).

- The app should load up at your previous location, no matter how long the app has been closed down. This is a no-brainer.

- The ability to slow down the content (some speakers do speak too quickly).

- The maximum volume is still way too low, and this is especially noticeable on about half the courses. You can say the iPad is the problem here, but that's not really the case. We can raise the volume in other apps much higher.

Instead of focusing on minor video playback tweaks, please focus on truly needed improvements.",Mark Freedman,1,1.9.4

Pluralsight does not bother about their clients and not even update the app after such bad reviews. May be they are too Microsoft focused hence don't bother about iOS.

9/24/2014,A developer oriented training course provider should do a lot better,"Pluralsight content is great. But the app is not. 

How come the Mechanics own car is leaking oil, batteries are not charged, indicators does not work and the car is really dirty?

These guys lives of teaching us how to do (mostly) development. But their own efforts in the App space is so so so bad. Their App should be the pinnacle of what is possible on iOS and other platforms. They do know the people who could make it happen?

1. Please make certain auto has full bluetooth headset support (start, stop, pause, forward/reverse)
2. Stop the app from taking so long to download/refresh the catalog
3. Make it easier to search and KEEP search result when you jump forward/backwards in search list
4. Sync progress between devices so I can see what I have watched before - even if I delete them from my downloaded content.

- better history
- bookmark support
- fixing that ""refreshing"" experience",Justin Obney,3,1.9.3
8/9/2014,Barely tolerable,"Since my negative review was ""lost"" I'll summarize it here.  

This app barely scratches the capabilities of the desktop and is more of a user irritant than an adjunct to those of us who subscribe to Pluralsight for good video training.

Limitations that irritate most involve the search functionality as well as the inability to share ""recently viewed"" information with other devices, even though I am logged on as a subscriber.  (And have been a subscriber for nearly three years.)

Other limitations are too numerous to list a second time (lost, huh?) but there are more.

I gave it two stars because the videos look nice if you find the one you want by mistake.",CynicPsyProg,2,1.9.3
8/4/2014,Terrible startup times,Like the other reviewers the app takes several minutes to startup for me.  I have the latest version of iOS on an iPhone 4 connected to 50mb network.   Once the app loads it works ok and allows you to watch the great Pluralsight videos.,Obbibobber,2,1.9.3

Since I'm watching some of the courses at work during my lunch hour on the browser, those modules watched are not reflected in the app. I think I will stick with the browser.",Rich_St,3,1.9.3
7/4/2014,"It used to be so-so, but it is much improved of late","I've been using this app for two years. Other than not showing when the videos were produced or the size of the files in mb when in the course, this app now works great. I'm very happy with it.",IWishUWell,5,1.9.3
6/24/2014,Practically Unusable By Itself,"First the app is primitive you can look by category or search but that is it. No filter or sorting. 

Next it does not show anywhere the release date for the videos. Since these are technology videos about software development and things age quickly in this world it is critical to know what the release date was of the video to know if it is still relevant and useful to what you want to learn. 

The date should be in the list and should be sortable by date as well as title.

Also there is no way to just look at the details, when you touch the row in the list it starts playing the video. When I touch the video it should take me to the details and allow me to play. OR and this would be better have a details and play button in the list and you can chose what to do.

So the only way this app is useful is if you already know the exact video or videos you want to watch from the website, and then just set them to be offline so you can then have a shorter list to use to view what you want.

In short its not really useful by itself, its to primitive for an app view to a subscription you are paying for. I mean Hulu and Netflix cost way less than this and they have amazing apps for watching videos, ones that paid subscription services should try to emulate.",Creepy Gnome,1,1.9.3
6/23/2014,Crash/freezes on old/new iPads,Worst app I've ever used on any idevice. I thought maybe it was freezing on my old 2nd gen iPad because of the old 5.1 iOS. Installed on my mini iPad Air with same result. Have to kill the app about every 5min and start it again to use it. Not a bandwidth issue either since we have 100mb at work and I have 50mb at home.

5/15/2013,Doesn't work,"Unable to watch a video for longer than a quarter of a second. Not sure what's going on there, but the app in this state is of no use.",Glitch0,1,1.7
5/7/2013,Absolutely amazing stuff.,"Great subjects mixed with great teachers mixed with real life implementation strategies mixed with - and this is the best part.  Every single module you leave, you will be assured you can to your computer and within minutes produce something useful. The classes are very hands on and you see every single line of code.  I love this system.  I cannot understand how anyone who is looking for training on core Microsoft technologies could not give this a 5 star rating.",kdicus,5,1.7
4/24/2013,"Great content, bad app",I have had this app for the better part of a year and it seems like I have a 50-50 chance of it working.  The latest issue seems to be videos refusing to load.  Please correct these issues in a timely fashion as this is a great tool for me to digest content in my spare time without being stuck in front of my laptop.,Napalm684,2,1.7
4/23/2013,Does not work,"Basically, this app worked for a few hours on the day of my subscription and not at all for the past 3 days.",efleming969,1,1.7
4/16/2013,"Great content, but app has problems","The content PluralSight is very good, but I am unable to get any of the videos to play for longer than about half of a second at a time. Thus, I am stuck using a computer to access the content.",caseyscarborough,2,1.7
4/3/2013,"Looks Great, functions poorly","I am unable to get it to play a video for more than 1 sec at a time. I was very excited to use this on my iPad with out having to use the browser, but due to this issue on my iPad3 i am stuck using the web....",RGlide650,2,1.7
3/20/2013,I really like the app but...,"I really like this app, perfect companion for my study time...i would really love to see a feature to watch videos offline.",Chetrucci,4,1.7
3/19/2013,App needs a little more work,"First the videos for pluralsight are excellent.  I am thoroughly enjoying them.  My review deals with issues regarding the app.  I have an iPad 2 and ever since Apple released IOS 6 and subsequent patches, I have had issues with lost connectivity with my wifi.  Now, it's incredibly annoying as I've read that it may be related to having bluetooth on or tweaking your wifi to use WEP.  Anyway, the lost connectivity adversely effects pluralsight's app as it will say it's ""fetching video"" but never gets anything after my connection is lost.  I have to either reboot or delete their app and reinstall it.  Pluralsight is aware of the problem and they did respond saying they would try to fix in a future update.  Once they fix this issue, I'll change my rating to either 4 or 5.",PandaBear75,3,1.7
3/13/2013,Well Done,"Great company. Great app.  Simple, easy to use, and consistent, uninterrupted playback on virtually any network.  Impressive.  Keep it up.",Ô£ø Tony Stark,5,1.7
3/2/2013,Mr,Plural sight is one of the best resource for learning new technology very quickly,Mohsen Vafa,5,1.7
2/26/2013,Awesome,It has a nice clean design and most importantly a lot of great content,brpyne,5,1.7
2/22/2013,Awesome,The ui is simple but extremely effective because plural sight is about content and I have no issues getting to the content I need.  Spot on use case.,Happy Puppy,5,1.7
2/21/2013,Barely minimum app,"The Pluralsight team really phoned this junker in:)

Although less buggy than before, this app lacks features and has flaws that make the user experience quite poor. 

To name a few:

--Search seems to pull items in that have low/no relevance to my keywords, with no sorting of relevance.
--Recently watched videos cannot be accessed directly --you have to go through the shoddy search described above.
--You can't click on any links provided in the video presentations.

This app reflects poorly on an otherwise awesome team and company. An app like this can only fuel the perception that Microsoft and its satellite developers produce unsexy, uninspired software that barely meets a spec and nothing more:( 

Be embarrased, you are all developers and need to represent!!",Guntsmash!,2,1.7
2/18/2013,There is no user experience,"Considering that Pluralsight is a paid site, they could have created a better app.  Basic functionality like my current watchlist is missing, leaving the user to remember what he was watching.",Jujiro1,4,1.7
2/17/2013,AirPlay is goofy,The latest update causes immediate crash on launch.  I had to uninstall/reinstall.,MikeF74,2,1.7
2/12/2013,Crashing app,I am unable to watch lessons on my iPhone the app crashes just before I pull up a video.,lorrodriguez,1,1.6.1
2/2/2013,Incomplete,"Con: Really needs favorites, history, filtering, better navigation, and notifications.  
Pro: Streaming works well even over 3G->Bluetooth connection.  The variable speed is a must have.  Auto play of video segments is appreciated.  Instructors of high quality.",Btparker1,3,1.6.1
1/27/2013,Needs lots of improvement,Needs the ability to track my classes. I also don't want to be refreshing the catalog should do that automatically.  Needs better UI design. Needs to be friendlier to use.,Marcelo Lewin,3,1.6.1
1/20/2013,Horrible App But Really Good Content (If You Can Get It),I really like the content from Pluralsight. Getting it to download the offline content so I can watch when I don't have a connection is quite a different matter. It usually takes more than five attempts to download each module. For a technical training company to not have someone (or some people) that can fix this issue should be quite embarrassing for them. C'mon Pluralsight... Fix this POS app.,The Rotten Apple,1,1.6.1
1/15/2013,Poor user experience,Works fine when you want to watch a video. Does not remember what session you are watching or where in the course your at. We should be able to shrink and expand the categories like on the web site.,Edgytech,2,1.6.1
1/12/2013,Usability for iPad version of the app is terrible,"Being a big fan of Pluralsight, I hate to say it but the iPad version of the app is awful. Not even close to what iPhone version offers. It hangs a few times on each (!!!) video and you have to restart the app to resume playback.

But resuming the app on your iPad implies you have to search the module you were watching from scratch again (!!!). I will continue to use it but as a Pluralsight customer who pays for the subscription I am quite disappointed.

Please, take this app serious or leave just an iPhone version so not to fuel an impression that horrible app equals of your trainings quality.",ptsurbeleu,2,1.6.1
1/10/2013,"Huge usability issues, very funny to see from dev experts","Huge usability issues, very funny to see from dev experts: is it hard to update catalog in the background? Why to wait on each run? Search is simply joke. Offline modules are not grouped and no progress indicator :(",PoohFromSpb,2,1.6.1
1/3/2013,Needs history,"Decent app, but it keeps losing track of where I was last time I ran a video.  That and I cannot see my viewing history like I can on my Mac.",IphoneDevGuy,3,1.6.1
12/28/2012,Flag subscribed courses,"Yea, I know this is not an issue for paid subscribers, but since you do offer some for free it would be so helpful to visually flag them in the TOC somehow. Thanks.",mobsite,4,1.6.1
12/24/2012,Doesn't work,This app doesn't play videos on my retina iPad. Progress indicator just spins and spins.,Pykachu,1,1.6.1
12/18/2012,"Good content, horrible app","Every time I try to play a video I get ""an error occurred during playback"" until I select the video again, then it plays. When it moves on to the next segment I get the same error, however I can't seem to find a way to get back to the playlist (in full screen mode) besides forcing the app to close. After I reopen the app I have to find the series again, select the video I tried to watch (even though it's marked as played!!), wait for the error, and select the video again... Rinse and repeat if you want to use full screen mode. Very frustrating!",crossfad3,1,1.6.1
12/13/2012,Can't see my courses,The app only shows all of the courses available from this vendor. There is no way to filter out to see only those classes I have purchased.,George rrrrrrrrr,2,1.6.1
12/1/2012,Well done,Very nice.  You guys hit it out of the park.,Pkellner99,5,1.6.1
11/27/2012,Issues with offline downloads,"If not for the issues with the offline downloads, I would be giving this a 5-star rating. 

Great training material and great presenters with terrific insight on the products to teach any subject with very good command. 

The app needs to get better in presenting and sync'ing the updates back and forth with online account. It doesn't help to see a downloaded module not playable or worse like ""the module you downloaded is no longer in your catalog. You must either remove it or redownload"" with apparent no reason for that message for all of a sudden. The only recourse I had was to remove all the offline modules and redownload them. What a pain especially when I only use this in offline mode.",Knight Srinivas,3,1.6.1
